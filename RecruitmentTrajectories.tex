\Abstract{
The role of tree diversity for tropical forests functioning and services
makes it crucial tree diversity and composition fate in the global
changing context. Community long-term response to disturbance rely on
tree recruitment, long seen as following deterministic successional
pathways. These pathways however might be altered in the hyper-diverse
tropical forests and of slight but recurrent disturbances induced by
global changes. Post-disturbance recruitment trajectories would (i)
disentangle the determinants of tree recruitment between stochastic and
deterministic processes that enhance a restricted pool of species, and
(ii) elucidate tropical forests taxonomic and functional resilience. We
examined the trajectories over 30 years of recruited trees taxonomic and
functional diversity in 12 plots of 6.25 ha of forest following a
disturbance gradient. We analyzed taxonomic richness, evenness, and
turnover, and functional diversity and composition (regarding 7 leaf,
stem and life-history functional traits). We revealed a three-phased
successional pathway defined by the interplay of stochastic and
deterministic recruitment processes. The succession translated into (i)
saplings growth maintaining pre-disturbance community diversity and
composition, (ii) light-demanding species enhanced recruitment
entailing, above a disturbance intensity threshold, the dominance of
pioneers and (iii) the recovery of pre-disturbance taxonomic and
functional characteristics and of stochastic recruitment processes.
Although tangible, community taxonomic and functional resilience was
decades-long. Post-disturbance recruitment relied on deterministic
competition processes for light balancing the stochastic processes
ruling undisturbed communities. Although resilient, recruitment
taxonomic and functional characteristics remained altered in the
long-term, calling caution for forest management.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\color{red} Determining the response of tropical forests to disturbance
is key to predict their fate in the global changing context. In the last
decades, tropical forests experienced a wide range of disturbance, from
radical land-use changes for agriculture or mining
\citep{Dezecache2017a, Dezecache2017b} to more insidious changes
following climatic changes or anthropogenic activities like selective
logging \citep{Baraloto2012a, Aubry-Kientz2015}. In that respect a vast
literature successfully modeled community response to disturbance in
terms of tree growth, tree height and fluxes of carbon, water, and
nutrients
\citep{Gourlet-Fleury2000, Putz2012, Piponiot2016, Rutishauser2016}. In
terms of tree community diversity and composition, the ecological theory
of succession assumes post-disturbance pathways driven by a succession
of deterministic recruitment processes. These pathways would track the
post-disturbance variations in resource availability, that imply a
succession of recruitment processes depending on species resource use
and competitive abilities \citep{Clements1916, Meiners2015}. The theory
assumes that the deterministic succession shaped predictable
trajectories gradually restoring communities pre-disturbance states
\citep{Chesson2000, Rees2001, Adler2007}. Specifically, in forest
ecosystem, tree species community succession first comprises the
recruitment of saplings benefiting from higher resources availability
and lower competition. Then, stand maturation progressively enforces the
exclusion of low-competitive species until the senescence of
early-successional species, and the emergence of late-successional ones
leading to the recovery of pre-disturbance composition and diversity
\citep{Denslow2000}. Empirical evidence, however, often show
post-disturbance trajectories deviating from the predictable succession
and resulting from an interplay of deterministic and stochastic
recruitment processes. Post-disturbance trajectories would then also
rely on stochastic processes, like dispersal limitations, and thus lead
to new equilibrium states instead of recovering towards the
pre-disturbance state \citep{Hubbell2001, Chave2004, Norden2015}. Hence,
the question is to determine the balance between deterministic and
stochastic recruitment processes. In the hyper-diverse tropical forests,
this balance is specifically debated. While several studies revealed
predictable and homogeneous successional patterns restoring the
pre-disturbance community \citep{Norden2009, Letcher2015}, others showed
diverging trajectories following disturbance and different equilibrium
state \citep{Longworth2014, Norden2015}.

Post-disturbance trajectories may correspond either to recruited trees
taxonomic characteristics, that refer to neutral species assemblages, or
to functional characteristics, that account for species ecology and
functioning \citep{Macarthur1967, Violle2007b, Kunstler2016}.
Deterministic processes correspond to a recruitment depending on species
competitive ability determined by their functional characteristics
\citep{Rees2001, Perronne2017}. Resulting recruitment trajectories would
be similar among communities. Specifically, as light is the limiting
resource in tropical forests, deterministic processes would drive a
functional succession from fast-growing species with ``acquisitive''
resource use, able of important and fast light acquisition, to
slow-growing, long-lived species with ``conservative'' resource use
\citep{Denslow1980, Molino2001, Bongers2009}.\\
Key leaf, wood and life-history functional traits assessing species
resources acquisition strategy and ecology would thus allow grasping the
deterministic processes involved in post-disturbance trajectories
\citep{Wright2004, Chave2009b, Herault2011}. Stochastic processes, in
turn, correspond to a random species recruitment independant of their
taxonomic identity and functional characteristics, and imply
trajectories diverging among communities. Because of the high diversity
and functional redundancy in tropical forests, tree community taxonomic
trajectories may not track functional ones. The combination of taxonomic
and functional approaches is then necessary to identify the different
recruitment processes involved
\citep{Fukami2005, Chalmandrier2015, Cequinel2018} and to conclude about
the recovery of pre-disturbance community
\citep{Clements1916, Diamond1975}.

Here, we followed recruitment trajectories over 30 years of 75 ha
cumulated area of Neotropical forest plots set up on a gradient of
disturbance intensity, from 10 to 60\% of aboveground standing biomass
removed. We examined recruited trees taxonomic composition, richness,
and evenness, taxonomic turnover compared to pre-disturbance community,
and functional composition and diversity based on seven major leaf,
stem, and life-history traits. We compared the recruitment trajectories
to neutral models corresponding to a stochastic recruitment and a
randomization of species functional traits. Specifically, we (i)
elucidated the successional pathway shaping community response to
disturbance and the underlying ecological processes, and (ii) clarified
the extent of community taxonomic and functional resilience, in the
sense of pre-disturbance characteristics recovery, and its consequences
for tropical forest management.

\section{Material and Methods}\label{material-and-methods}

\subsection{Study Site}\label{study-site}

The Paracou station is located in a lowland tropical rainforest in
French Guiana (518\textdegree N and 5253\textdegree W). Climate is
tropical wet with mean annual precipitation averaging 2980
mm.yr\textsuperscript{-1} (30-yr period) and a 3-months dry season
(\textless{} 100 mm.mo\textsuperscript{-1}) from mid-August to
mid-November, and a one-month dry season in March \citep{Wagner2011}.
The mean annual temperature is 26\textdegree C. Elevation ranges from 5
to 50 m.

\color{red} Across all plots, the topography mainly corresponds to
hilltops or hillsides, and bottomlands cover less than 1 \% of the area.
Plots are shallow ferralitic acrisols over a layer of transformed
saprolite with low permeability and lateral drainage. Soil conditions
are homogeneous, to the exception of the highest hilltops where the
thick surface allows a free vertical drainage
\citep{Gourlet-Fleury2004}. \color{black}

The experiment is a network of twelve 6.25 ha plots (Table
\ref{tab:Tab1}) that underwent three disturbance treatments in 1987
according to a randomized plot design \citep{Herault2018}.

\color{red} The experiment comprised three replicates of three
sylvicultural treatments (hereafter plots T1, T2 and T3) and three
control plots (T0). All treatments T1, T2 and T3 comprised the logging
of 10 trees/ha with 50 cm minimum DBH that belonged to a set of 58
commercially exploited species \citep{Gourlet-Fleury2004}. Treatment T2
additionally comprised a thinning treatment by poison-girdling of
non-commercially exploited species, randomly selected species with an
average 30 trees/ha with 40 cm minimum DBH. Treatment T3 additionally
comprised the logging of 15 trees /ha with 40 cm minimum DBH and the
poison-girdling of 20 trees/ha with a 50 cm minimum DBH, all belonging
to non-commercial species. Considering the silvicultural treatments and
the following damage, disturbance intensity was measured as the
percentage of aboveground standing biomass of trees above 10 cm DBH
(\%AGB) lost between the first inventory in 1984 and five years after
disturbance \citep{Piponiot2016}, estimated with the BIOMASS R package
\citep{Biomass2018}, and without accounting for lianas. The three
treatments constituted a disturbance intensity gradient with increasing
of above-ground biomass (AGB) lost and surface disturbed. \color{black}

\begin{table}

\end{tabu}
\end{table}

\subsection{Inventories Protocol and Dataset
Collection}\label{inventories-protocol-and-dataset-collection}

Dominant families in the study site are \emph{Fabaceae},
\emph{Chrysobalanaceae}, \emph{Lecythidaceae} and \emph{Sapotaceae}. All
trees above 10 cm DBH were mapped and measured annually since 1984.
Trees are first identified with a vernacular name assigned by the forest
worker team, and afterward with a scientific name assigned by botanists
during regular botanical campaigns. Botanical campaigns have been
carried out every five to six years from 2003 onwards, but
identification levels varied between campaigns.

The variability of protocols in time raised methodological issues as
vernacular names usually correspond to different botanical species. This
variability resulted in significant taxonomic uncertainties that had to
be propagated to composition and diversity metrics. The uncertainty
propagation was done through a Bayesian framework reconstituting
complete inventories at genus level from real incomplete ones on the
basis of vernacular/botanical names association. Vernacular names were
replaced through multinomial trials based on the association probability
\(\big[\alpha_1, \alpha_2,..., \alpha_N\big]\) observed across all
inventories between each vernacular name \emph{v} and the species
\(\big[s_1, s_2,..., s_N\big]\):

\begin{align}
M_v\Big(\big[s_1, s_2,..., s_N\big],\big[\alpha_1, \alpha_2,..., \alpha_N\big]\Big) \nonumber
\end{align}

See appendix 1 and \citet{Aubry-Kientz2013} for the detailed
methodology.

To minimize the remaining identification uncertainties, the simulated
botanical inventories were reported at genus level.

We considered six functional traits representing leaf economics, the
leaf thickness, toughness, total chlorophyll content and specific leaf
area, and stem economics, the wood specific gravity and bark thickness.
These traits were obtained from the BRIDGE project \footnote{http://www.ecofog.gf/Bridge/},
which proved to reliably assess species functional traits and community
functional diversity \citep{Paine2015}. Trait values were assessed from
a selection of individuals located in nine permanent plots in French
Guiana, including two in Paracou, and comprised 294 species belonging to
157 genera.

\color{red} For the trait value at species level we took the median
value of the several trees sampled in the database, which allowed
accounting for intraspecific variability although we considered
species-level trait values. \color{black}

Whenever a species was in the dataset was missing some trait values
(10\% of the species), missing values were filled using multivariate
imputation by chained equation \citep{Mice2011}. To account for the
phylogenetic signal in the filling process, imputations based on samples
from the same genus or from the same family. Whenever a species was not
in the dataset, it was attributed a set of trait values randomly sampled
among species of the next higher taxonomic level (same genus or family).
Two life-history traits (maximum specific height and seed mass) came
from the Mariwenn database \footnote{https://www.ecofog.gf/mariwenn/}.
The database compiles information from a vast literature on the flora of
French Guiana \citep{Ollivier2007} and comprises 362 species belonging
to 188 genera. As seed mass information was classified into classes, no
data filling process was applied and analyses were restricted to the
botanical species recorded.

All composition and diversity metrics were obtained after 50 iterations
of the uncertainty propagation framework.

\subsection{Recruitment trajectories}\label{recruitment-trajectories}

\color{red} Communities were split into surviving trees of
pre-disturbance communities and trees recruited afterward. Trajectories
of recruitment diversity (hereafter \(H^q_{obs}\)) and turnover started
from the first year after disturbance and then considered the trees
recruited by 2-years intervals (\emph{i.e.} for the date Y, the trees
that were under 10 cm DBH at Y-1 but above 10 cm DBH at Y).
\color{black}

Trajectories of taxonomic diversity were assessed through species
richness and evenness (the Hill number translation of the Simpson index)
\citep{Chao2015, Marcon2015}. The two diversities belong to the set of
Tsallis or generalized entropy, respectively corresponding to the zero
and two order \emph{q} of diversity that emphasizes common species
\color{red} regarding their stem density. These two metrics assess
community richness and evenness, that reveals the structure of dominance
in the community and allow grasping the changes in community abundance
distribution. Both metric are complementary to detect the changes in
community structure \citep{Magurran2004}. \color{black}

Functional diversity trajectories were assessed through the Rao index of
quadratic entropy, which combines species abundance distribution and
average pairwise dissimilarity based on all functional traits.
Functional composition trajectories were assessed through functional
traits Community Weighted Means (CWM). CWM are average trait value in
the community weighted by species relative abundance in number of stem
\citep{Diaz2007}. For graphical representation, CWM trajectories are
represented through the fitted lines of generalised additive models
adjusted at treatment level \citep{Wood2011}. Seed mass trajectories
were reported by the stems proportion of each class recorded in the
inventories.

\color{red} The taxonomic similarity between recruited trees and
pre-disturbance forest was measured with the relativized abundance
replacement measuring species turnover between communities
\citep{Podani2013a}:

\begin{equation}
T_{ab}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}|x_i^a - x_i^b| - \bigg| \sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_i^a} - \sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_i^b} \bigg|}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\max{\left( x_i^a;x_i^b \right)}}
\label{eq:formNestedness}
\end{equation}

With \(Tab\) the turnover between communities \(a\) and \(b\), \(n\) the
total number of species in the two communities and \(x_{ij}\) the
abundance of species \(I\) in community \(j\).

The correlation between the initial disturbance intensity and recruited
community taxonomic richness and evenness, functional richness and
taxonomic turnover were tested through Spearman rank correlation tests.
\color{black}

The observed recruitment trajectories were compared to null trajectories
obtained from taxonomic and functional null models. A taxonomic null
model was independently built for each plot and for each year. Taxonomic
null trajectories were simulated by randomly sampling the recruited
trees in the current living community, according to the observed number
of recruits. Functional null trajectories were simulated by randomly
reassigning the combinations of functional trait values among species.
The functional null models maintained the community abundance
distribution while randomizing the relative abundance of trait values
\citep{Mason2013}. Trajectories of null diversity (hereafter
\(H^q_{null}\)) were similarly obtained after 50 iterations of the
random sampling models.

\color{red} \#\# Identification of indicative species

We identified characteristic species of post-disturbance recruitment by
computing species indicator values for post-disturbance and undisturbed
recruited communities. We used the methodology developed in
\citet{Dufrene1997}. Indicator species are defined as the most
characteristic species of a group: it would be species only found in
that group and recorded in the majority of the plots belonging to this
group. All disturbed plots were pooled in the disturbed group and
opposed to the undisturbed plots. \(IndVal_{ij}\) is the indicator value
of species i relative to group j. It is the product of \(A_{ij}\), a
measure of species specificity, by \(B_{ij}\), a measure of species
fidelity. \(A_{ij}\) is the mean abundance of species \(i\) in each plot
\(j\) of the group compared to all groups in the study. \(A_{ij}\) is
maximum when species \(i\) is only present in group \(j\). \(B_{ij}\) is
the relative frequency of occurence if species \(i\) in the plots of
group \(j\), it is maximum when species \(i\) is only present in all
plots of group \(j\).

\begin{equation}
A_{ij} = Nindividuals_{ij} / Nindividuals_{i.}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
B_{ij} = Nsites_{ij} / Nsites_{.j}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
IndVal_{ij} = A_{ij} x B_{ij} x 100
\end{equation}

In the formula for \(A_{ij}\), \(Nindividuals_{ij}\) is the number of
individuals of species \(i\) in plots of group \(j\) and
\(Nindividuals_{i.}\) is the sum of the mean number of individuals of
species \(i\) over all groups. In the formula for \(B_{ij}\),
\(Nsites_{ij}\) is the number of plots in group \(j\) where species
\(i\) is recorded and \(Nsites_{j}\) is the total number of sites. The
Indicator Value of a species is the maximum value of \(IndVal_{ij}\),
expressed in percentage, observed across all groups. The indicator value
is maximal when all individuals of species \(i\) are observed in all
plots of one group.

The significance of species indicator values was tested through the
comparison with a random permutaiton procedure of sites among groups.
Observed values were compared to the mean values obtained from 50 random
permutations with a z statistic. \color{black}

\section{Results}\label{results}

\color{red} \#\# Indicative species and species repartition

Overall, 602 species were recorded along the 30 years of inventory and
across the 12 plots. Among all species, 157 were only inventoried in one
plot and 43 were inventoried in all plots. Species repartition is
detailed in table 2.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:Tab2}Recruited species repartition across treatments: number of species inventoried and species only recruited in the treatment considered}
\centering
\begin{tabu} to \linewidth {>{\raggedright}X>{\raggedright}X>{\raggedright}X>{\raggedright}X>{\raggedright}X}
\toprule
 & Control & T1 & T2 & T3\\
\midrule
Number of species by treatment & 373 & 313 & 390 & 432\\
Number of species recruited only in one treatment & 42 & 30 & 43 & 81\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabu}
\end{table}

The dominant recruited species were \emph{Lecythis persistens},
\emph{Licania alba}, \emph{Oenocarpus bataua}, \emph{Oxandra asbeckii},
and \emph{Eperua grandiflora}. The dominant species recruited in
disturbed plots were \emph{Miconia tschudyoides}, \emph{Inga sp.},
\emph{Oenocarpus bataua}, \emph{Licania alba}, and \emph{Xylopia sp.}.

We defined the indicative species of a group when their indicative value
was above 90\%. Indicative species of undisturbed communities were
\emph{Couepia bracteosa} and species of the genus \emph{Neea}.
Indicative species of post-disturbance communities were species of the
genuses \emph{Cecropia}, \emph{Cupania}, \emph{Apeiba}, \emph{Pourouma},
\emph{Sterculia}, \emph{Tapirira}, \emph{Vismia}, and the species
\emph{Miconia tschudyoides}, \emph{Schefflera decaphylla}, \emph{Virola
surinamensis}, and \emph{Xylopia nitida}. Among disturbance-indicator
species, genus \emph{Cecropia}, \emph{Apeiba}, \emph{Vismia} and
\emph{Pourouma} were representative of the first years following
disturbance while \emph{Cupania}, \emph{Xylopia}, \emph{Miconia} and
\emph{Sterculia} were characteristic of later time after disturbance.
\color{black}

\subsection{Taxonomic richness and evenness and functional
diversity}\label{taxonomic-richness-and-evenness-and-functional-diversity}

\color{red} The average number of recruited trees per plot and per year
along the whole time survey increased with the increasing disturbance
intensity. For a 2-year laps, the number of recruits per plot was around
74 in plots T0, 142 in plots T1, 211 in plots T2 and 273 in plots T3. In
total, during the 30 years, 602 species were recruited across the 12
plots. Among thoses, 26\% occured in one plot only and 7\% occured in
all plots. \color{black}

In undisturbed communities the taxonomic richness and evenness of
recruited trees remained stable over the 30 years, around values
equivalent to those of the taxonomic null model (Figure
(\ref{fig:DivTraj})).

In disturbed communities the taxonomic richness followed hump-shaped
trajectories first increasing until a maximum reached after around 15
years and positively correlated to the disturbance intensity
(\(\rho^{Richness}_{spearman}=0.93\)). The taxonomic richness then
decreased and recovered the pre-disturbance values after 30 years.
Compared to the null models, the observed taxonomic richness was lower
than the richness of a random species recruitment. The difference
between the observed and null model richness followed a hump-shaped
trajectory with a maximum difference reached after 15 years. In all
disturbed communities, the taxonomic evenness decreased whenever the
disturbance intensity over the 30 years
(\(\rho^{simpson}_{spearman}=-0.35\)). Compared to the null model, the
observed taxonomic eveness was lower than the evenness of a random
species recruitment. The difference between the observed and null model
evenness followed a hump-shaped trajectory with a maximum difference
reached around 25 years after disturbance.

The functional diversity in the undisturbed plots remained stable and
equivalent to this of the functional null model over the 30 years. In
the lowest disturbance plots the functional diversity remained stable or
slightly increasing, and was higher than this of the null model for two
of the T1 plots. In the disturbed plots of higher disturbance intensity
(T2 and T3) the functional diversity decreased until 15 years after
disturbance, when it started to recover towards initial values. The
observed functional diversity remained lower than this of the null model
over the 30 years.

\subsection{Functional composition}\label{functional-composition}

In undisturbed plots functional traits values remained stable over the
30 years while it followed hump-shaped trajectories in all disturbed
plots, to the exception of the leaf chlorophyll content. Trajectories of
SLA and bark thickness first increased before decreasing towards initial
values. Conversely, trajectories of leaf thickness, leaf toughness, wood
specific gravity, and maximum height first decreased and then started
returning towards initial values but their recovery remained unachieved
after 30 years (Figure \ref{fig:CWM}).

\subsection{Recruitment Turnover}\label{recruitment-turnover}

Over the 30 years in control plots the turnover of recruited species
compared to initial community remained low (Figure \ref{fig:Turnover}).
In disturbed plots the recruited species turnover followed a marked
hump-shaped trajectory, with a maximum reached around 15 years after
disturbance. The maximum turnover was positively correlated to the
disturbance intensity (\(\rho_{spearman}=0.93\)). Thirty years after
disturbance the turnover had returned to low values.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

\color{red} Our analysis of the taxonomic and functional response of
tree recruitment over 30 years following a disturbance gradient revealed
a three-phased successional pathway shaped by an interplay between
stochastic recruitment and deterministic processes. Although the
recruitment trajectories suggested community taxonomic and functional
recovery, the return to the initial stage remained unachieved after 30
years.

\subsection{A three-phased deterministic successional
pathway}\label{a-three-phased-deterministic-successional-pathway}

Post-disturbance recruitment trajectories followed a three-phased
successional pathway defined by the emergence of deterministic
competition processes for light, that balanced the stochastic processes
involved in undisturbed communities before disturbance. Indicative
species of disturbed plots corresponded to pionners and light demanding
species while indicative species of undistrubed plots were
shade-tolerant, late successional species.

A first phase (\emph{i.e.} 0-8 years) was defined by a very low
taxonomic turnover between recruited trees and initial communities
(Figure \ref{fig:Turnover}), and by similar taxonomic and functional
trajectories matching the null model trajectories (Figure
(\ref{fig:DivTraj})). The first phase corresponded to the time lapse
before recruitment processes markedly changed. During this phase,
recruits comprised a few pioneer species, like \emph{Cecropia obtusa},
and rather corresponded to the growth of pre-disturbance surviving
saplings (with DBH \textless{} 10 cm), that were late-successional
species like \emph{Lecythis persistens} or \emph{Licania alba}. These
species displayed ``resource-conservative'' functional strategies,
\emph{i.e.} dense leaf and wood tissues and low exchange surface,
favored in undisturbed communities where light levels are low
\citep{Peet1992, Denslow2000}. These saplings were the first to benefit
from the alleviated competition and the higher light availability that
is known to follow disturbance and foster plant productivity and growth
\citep{Monteith1972, Chazdon1984}.

A second phase (\emph{i.e.} 8-15 years) was marked by an increase of the
taxonomic turnover between recruited trees and initial communities, and
a decrease of recruits richness and evenness compared to the null model.
The second phase also corresponded to a shift in recruits functional
composition towards more ``resource-acquisitive'' strategies. Indicative
species switched from pioneers of genus \emph{Cecropia} or
\emph{Vismia}, to non-pioneer light demanding species of genuses
\emph{Cupania}, \emph{Xylopia} or \emph{Miconia}. The shift would mark
the recruitment of trees germinated from seeds, eventually representing
the main part of the recruitment \citep{Lawton1988}. This first phase
was the time lapse before pioneers, like \emph{Miconia tschudyoides},
\emph{Inga spp.}, \emph{Tapirira spp.}, and \emph{Cecropia spp.}, became
dominant among recruits. The dominance of pioneers decreased the
taxonomic richness and evenness of recruited trees and made the
recruitment trajectories depart from those of the null model.
Recruitment processes then changed after disturbance, with the emergence
of deterministic processes favoring a restricted pool of species. During
the second phase, the recruitment functional composition switched from a
random trait assembly to more ``resource-acquisitive'' functional
strategies (Figure (\ref{fig:CWM})). Species displaying high SLA and low
maximum height, leaf toughness and wood specific gravity became dominant
\citep{Wright2004, Chave2009b, Herault2011}. During the second
succession phase, a net advantage then emerged for species displaying
efficient light acquisition, with high SLA and leaf chlorophyll content,
and displaying inexpensive, short-lived tissues, with low leaf
thickness, leaf toughness, small Hmax, low wood specific gravity, and
low bark thickness. The advantage gained by ``light acquisitive''
species confirmed the role of light availability in the post-disturbance
successional pathways, as already demonstrated in temperate and tropical
forests \citep{Pena2008, Carreno2012, Kunstler2016, Both2019}. The
emergence of deterministic processes favoring pioneers balanced the
neutral species assemblage where late-successional species were
dominant, like in undisturbed communities. Deterministic processes made
post-disturbance trajectories depart from the null trajectories, all the
more so that the disturbance was intense (Figure (\ref{fig:DivTraj})).
Following low intensity disturbance (T1 plots), pioneers and
late-successional species were balanced \citep{Bongers2009}. Following
intense disturbance (T2 and T3 plots), deterministic processes prevailed
and the composition of recruited communities rapidly differed from this
of the pre-disturbance community.

A third recruitment ongoing phase (starting around 15 years) was
delineated by a return towards pre-disturbance values of functional
diversity and taxonomic richness, while taxonomic evenness and
functional composition remained altered (Figure (\ref{fig:DivTraj}) \&
(\ref{fig:CWM})). Although recruited species were mainly light-demanding
and pioneers, like species from \emph{Inga}, \emph{Miconia}, or
\emph{Licania} genera, late-successional species progressively settled,
like \emph{Licania alba} \citep{Fortunel2014}. The recruitment of
late-successionals would translate the progressive closing of forest
canopy and the increase competition for light and space
{[}\citet{Peet1992};\citet{Denslow2000};{]} Deterministic recruitment
processes then gradually left room again to stochastic recruitment as
observed in undisturbed forest \citep{Lawton1988, Chave2004}.

\subsection{Community recovery}\label{community-recovery}

Following disturbance, community taxonomic and functional composition
recovered towards pre-disturbance values. Such recovery confirmed
previous results from the Paracou experiment, conducted 10 years
\citep{Molino2001} and 20 years \citep{Baraloto2012a} after disturbance,
where the early signs of the resilience of pre-disturbance taxonomic and
functional composition recovery had been detected.

Thirty years after disturbance, the taxonomic and functional diversity
and composition of the recruited community returned towards
pre-disturbance states \citep{Fukami2005, Fortunel2014}. The recovery of
pre-disturbance states meant the maintenance of community diversity and
composition, and a low recruitment of species absent in the
pre-disturbance community. It then confirmed the importance of dispersal
limitations among tropical tree species \citep{Svenning2005}.

Although community taxonomic and functional recovery was ongoing, both
remained altered 30 years after disturbance. Besides, the recovery of
community taxonomic richness was faster, while this of the functional
richness tracked the trajectory of the taxonomic evenness
\citep{Grime1998}. The higher the disturbance intensity, the more
persistent the dominance of light-demanding species. Such long-term
impact raises questions for tropical forests management as most valuable
species are late-successional species, so their exploitation would
require cutting cycles longer than 30 years \citep{Putz2012}. Besides,
persistent changes in community composition likely alters community
functioning \citep{Diaz2005}, and increases the risk of losing keystone
species, with unexpected ecological consequences
\citep{Jones1994, Chazdon2003a}. Infrequent species might indeed have
unique functional characteristics in the ecosystem, apart from the ones
considered here, or be a key resource for some of the fauna
\citep{Schleuning2016}.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

Post-disturbance recruitment trajectories revealed a three-phased
deterministic successional pathway driven by the emergence of
trait-based deterministic processes balancing pre-disturbance stochastic
processes, and enhancing light-acquisitive species. A first phase
corresponded to the recruitment of pre-disturbance surviving saplings
maintaining the taxonomic and functional diversity and composition of
pre-disturbance communities. A second phase corresponded to the
recruitment of true recruits from germinating seeds, belonging to a
restricted pool of pioneers, that were favored by the emergence of
competitive exclusion for light. Above a disturbance intensity
threshold, the second recruitment phase saw the dominance of
short-lived, fast growing pioneers that drastically changed community
composition, diversity, and likely functioning. A third phase eventually
corresponded to the recovery of stochastic recruitment processes and to
the return towards pre-disturbance taxonomic and functional
characteristics. Although resilient, recruits diversity and composition
remained altered 30 years after disturbance, all the more so that
disturbance was intense. Regarding forest management, our results
supported cutting cycles longer than 30 years and demonstrated long-term
impacts emphasising the need to evaluate forest management
sustainability. \color{black}
