<p>In all, 602 species were recorded over the 30 years of inventory and across the 12 plots. Among species, 157 were only inventoried in one plot and 43 were inventoried in all plots.
Species distribution is detailed in table 2, and the complete list of species inventoried is provided in Supplementary Table S3. The dominant recruited species were <em>Lecythis persistens</em>, <em>Licania alba</em>, <em>Oenocarpus bataua</em>, <em>Oxandra asbeckii</em>, and <em>Eperua grandiflora</em>.
The dominant species recruited in disturbed plots were <em>Miconia tschudyoides</em>, <em>Inga sp.</em>, <em>Oenocarpus bataua</em>, <em>Licania alba</em>, and <em>Xylopia sp.</em>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Taxonomic richness and evenness, and functional diversity</h2>
<p>The average number of recruited trees per plot and per year throughout the survey increased with increasing disturbance intensity. For a 2-year time lapse, the average number of recruits per plot was 74 in plots T0, 142 in plots T1, 211 in plots T2 and 273 in plots T3. Over the 30-year period, a total of 602 species were recruited across the 12 plots. Among these species, 26% only occurred in one plot and 7% occurred in all plots.</p>
<p>In undisturbed communities, the taxonomic richness and evenness of the recruited trees remained stable over the 30-year period, with values equivalent to those of the taxonomic null model (<a href="results.html#fig:DivTraj">3.1</a>)).</p>
<p>In disturbed communities, the taxonomic richness followed hump-shaped trajectories first increasing and reaching maximum after around 15 years. This maximum was positively correlated with disturbance intensity (<span class="math inline">\(\rho^{Richness}_{spearman}=0.93\)</span>).
Taxonomic richness then decreased and recovered pre-disturbance values after 30 years.
Compared to the null models, the observed taxonomic richness in disturbed plots was significantly lower than the richness of random species recruitment. The confidence interval of the difference between observed and null models remained well under zero in all disturbed plots.
In all disturbed communities, the taxonomic evenness decreased whenever the disturbance intensity over the 30 years (<span class="math inline">\(\rho^{simpson}_{spearman}=-0.35\)</span>).
Compared to the null model, the observed taxonomic evenness was significantly lower than the evenness of a random species recruitment. The difference between the observed
and null model evenness followed a hump-shaped trajectory where maximum difference was reached around 25 years after the original disturbance. The confidence interval of the difference between null and observed trajectories remained well below zero in all the disturbed plots.</p>
<p>The functional diversity in the undisturbed plots remained stable and equivalent to that of the functional null model over the 30-year period. In the plots with the least disturbance, functional diversity remained stable or increased slightly and was higher than that of the null model in two of the T1 plots.
In disturbed plots with higher disturbance intensity (T2 and T3), functional diversity decreased until 15 years after disturbance, and then started to recover initial values. The observed functional diversity remained lower than that of the null model over the 30-year period.
However, the difference between null and observed functional trajectories was only significant in the most highly disturbed plots (T3).</p>

<p>Functional traits in undisturbed plots remained stable over the 30-year period whereas in all the disturbed plots, with the exception of leaf chlorophyll content, the trajectories were hump-shaped. The trajectories of SLA and bark thickness initially increased before decreasing towards initial values. Conversely, trajectories of leaf thickness, leaf toughness, wood specific gravity, and maximum height first decreased and then started returning to their initial values but their recovery was still not complete at the end of the 30-year period (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:CWM">3.2</a>).</p>

<p>The turnover of recruited species in control plots compared to the initial community remained low over the 30-year period (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:Turnover">3.3</a>).
In disturbed plots the turnover of the recruited species followed a marked hump-shaped trajectory, with a maximum reached about 15 years after the disturbance. The maximum turnover was positively correlated with disturbance intensity (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}=0.93\)</span>).
Thirty years after the disturbance, the turnover had returned to low values.</p>
