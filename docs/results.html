<p><strong>Recruitment Diversity</strong></p>
<p><em>Punctual and accumulated recruits’ diversity</em> The diversity of trees recruited in T1, T2 and T3 logged plots constituted a community with lower richness and lower evenness than observed for the control plots. The OLS analysis proved a significant time-dependence of the punctual recruitment diversity for the three diversity order, Richness, Shannon and Simpson and a significant effect of the logging treatment (P&lt;0.01 in any case). It besides proved a significant time-dependence of the accumulated recruitment diversity for the three order and a significant effect of the logging.</p>

<p><strong>Recruitment Turnover</strong></p>
<p>The abundance turnover of recruited trees compared to the initial stand inventoried before exploitation remained even for the 30 sampled years in the control plots whereas it showed a first significant increase for 15 years after exploitation in all logged plots. The increase depended on the logging intensity with higher abundance turnover after the most intense exploitation. The turnover then decreased in all plots from 15 years after exploitation and plots of all treatments displayed a turnover equal to the control plots from 25 years after exploitation.</p>
