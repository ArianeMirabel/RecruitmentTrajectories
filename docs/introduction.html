The role of tree diversity in tropical forests functioning and ecosystem services provision means tree diversity and composition are crucial under the global changing context. Long-term community response to disturbance has long been seen as following deterministic successional pathways. However, these pathways remain to be tested in hyper-diverse tropical forests and might be altered in the global change context. Post-disturbance recruitment trajectories can (i) distinguish the determinants of tree recruitment between stochastic and deterministic processes that enhance a restricted pool of species, and (ii) elucidate the return of the taxonomic and functional diversity of recruitment processes in tropical forests. Amazonian rainforest, Paracou station, French Guiana. We examined the trajectories of taxonomic and functional diversity of recruited trees over a period of 30 years in twelve forest plots each 6.25 ha in size following a disturbance gradient. We analyzed taxonomic richness, evenness, and turnover, and functional diversity and composition of seven leaf, stem and life-history functional traits. We reveal a three-phase successional pathway defined by the interplay between stochastic and deterministic recruitment processes. Succession resulted in (i) enhanced growth of already settled saplings which diversity and composition were similar to these of the pre-disturbance community, (ii) enhanced recruitment of light-demanding species that, above a disturbance intensity threshold, resulted in the dominance of pioneers and (iii) the recovery of pre-disturbance taxonomic and functional characteristics and of stochastic recruitment processes. We observed a tangible but decades-long return to community pre-disturbance diversity and composition regarding taxonomic characteristics and functional characteristics based on seven key functional traits. Post-disturbance recruitment was driven by the emergence of competition processes, favoring species with efficient light use and acquisition, that would gradually balance in time the stochastic recruitment at stake in undisturbed communities. Although resilient, recruitment taxonomic and functional characteristics were altered in the long run, calling for caution on the part of forest managers.

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Determining the response of tropical forests to disturbance is a key to predicting their fate in the context of global climate change. In recent decades, tropical forests have experienced a wide range of disturbances, from radical land-use changes for agriculture or mining <span class="citation">(Dezécache, Faure, et al. 2017; Dezécache, Salles, et al. 2017)</span> to more insidious changes following climate change or human activities like selective logging <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012; Aubry-Kientz et al. 2015)</span>.
In that respect a vast literature has successfully modeled community response to disturbance in terms of tree growth, tree height and fluxes of carbon, water and nutrients <span class="citation">(Gourlet-Fleury and Houllier 2000; Putz et al. 2012; Piponiot et al. 2016; Rutishauser et al. 2016)</span>.
In terms of tree community diversity and composition, the ecological theory of succession assumes post-disturbance pathways driven by a succession of deterministic recruitment processes. These pathways are hypothesized to follow the post-disturbance variations in resource availability that imply a succession of recruitment processes depending on the species use of resources and competitive abilities <span class="citation">(Clements 1916; Meiners et al. 2015)</span>.
The theory assumes that deterministic succession shapes predictable trajectories gradually restoring the pre-disturbance state of the community <span class="citation">(Chesson 2000; Rees et al. 2001; Adler, HilleRislambers, and Levine 2007)</span>.
Specifically, in forest ecosystems, tree species community succession first involves the recruitment of saplings that benefit from higher resources availability and reduced competition. Then, stand maturation progressively enforces the exclusion of low-competitive species until the early-successional species disappear, and late-successional species emerge leading to the recovery of pre-disturbance composition and diversity<span class="citation">(Denslow and Guzman 2000)</span>.
However, empirical evidence often reveals post-disturbance trajectories that diverge from the predictable succession and result from interplay between deterministic and stochastic recruitment processes <span class="citation">(Brokaw and Busing 2000)</span>.
Post-disturbance trajectories are also hypothesized to rely on stochastic processes, e.g. dispersal limitations, and thus lead to new equilibrium states instead of recovering their pre-disturbance state <span class="citation">(Hubbell 2001; Chave 2004; Norden et al. 2015)</span>.
Hence, we need to determine the balance between deterministic and stochastic recruitment processes. In hyper-diverse tropical forests, this balance is the subject of debate. While several studies revealed predictable and homogeneous successional patterns that restored the pre-disturbance community <span class="citation">(Norden et al. 2009; Letcher et al. 2015)</span> others revealed diverging post disturbance trajectories and different equilibrium states <span class="citation">(Longworth et al. 2014; Norden et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>Post-disturbance trajectories either refer to the taxonomic characteristics of recruited trees that correspond to neutral species assemblages, or to their functional characteristics that account for species ecology and functioning <span class="citation">(MacArthur and Levins 1967; Violle et al. 2007; Kunstler et al. 2016)</span>.
Deterministic processes correspond to recruitment that depends on the species competitive ability determined by their functional characteristics <span class="citation">(Rees et al. 2001; Perronne et al. 2017)</span>.
As light is the limiting resource in tropical forests, deterministic processes are thought to drive functional succession from fast-growing species with “acquisitive” resource use, capable of significant and rapid acquisition of light, to slow-growing, long-lived species with “conservative” resource use <span class="citation">(Denslow 1980; Molino and Sabatier 2001; Bongers et al. 2009)</span>.
Would the deterministic recruitment processes rely on species light use strategy, communities trajectories would be independent of community diversity and composition.</p>
<p>Using key leaf, wood and life-history functional traits to assess the species resources acquisition strategy and ecology could thus elucidate the deterministic processes involved in post-disturbance trajectories <span class="citation">(Wright et al. 2004; Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011)</span>.
Stochastic processes, in turn, correspond to random species recruitment independent of the species taxonomic identity and functional characteristics, and imply diverging trajectories among communities. Because of the high diversity and functional redundancy in tropical forests, tree community taxonomic trajectories, <em>i.e.</em> regarding species composition and diversity, may not track functional ones. A combination of taxonomic and functional approaches is thus necessary to identify the different recruitment processes involved <span class="citation">(Fukami et al. 2005; Chalmandrier et al. 2015; Cequinel et al. 2018)</span> and to resolve the debate concerning the recovery of the pre-disturbance state of the community <span class="citation">(Clements 1916; Diamond 1975)</span>.</p>
<p>Here, we followed recruitment trajectories in a 75-ha cumulated area of Neotropical forest plots subject to a gradient of disturbance intensity, between 10% and 60% of above-ground standing biomass removed. We examined community composition, richness, evenness, and turnover of recruited trees over 30-year and compared to the pre-disturbance community. We considered both taxonomic aspects, accounting for tree species diversity and composition, and functional aspects, accounting for seven major leaf, stem, and life-history traits. We compared the recruitment trajectories with neutral models corresponding to stochastic recruitment and a randomization of species functional traits. Specifically, we (i) elucidated the successional pathway shaping community response to disturbance and the underlying ecological processes, and (ii) clarified the return of recruitment processes to pre-disturbance values of taxonomic and functional diversity and composition.</p>
