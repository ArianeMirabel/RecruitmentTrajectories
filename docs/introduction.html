<p>Trees biodiversity is central for tropical forests functioning and services. In the current climatic and land-use changing context it is urgent to clarify the response of communities diversity and composition to disturbance. Succession patterns shaped by deterministic recruitment processes are recognized to shape communities trajectories after disturbance but those need be tested for highly biodiverse tropical forests and for cases where the initial communities are partly maintained like selective logging and climatic changes. Recruitment trajectories would allow (i) disentangling neutral, stochastic and deterministic, selective processes shaping post-disturbance succession, and (ii) clarify the taxonomic and functional facets of forests resilience. We examined the trajectories over 30 years of recruitment diversity and composition in 75 ha of a neotropical forest following a gradient of logging and thinning disturbance (from 15 to 60% of AGB removed). Specifically we analysed and compared to neutral models the recruitment trajectories in taxonomic richness, evennes, and compositional turnover compared to initial communities, and in Rao functional diversity integrating species ecology through 7 key functional traits. We evidenced three recruitment phases shaped by the gradual balance between stochastic and deterministic processes. First, trajectories relied upon the growth of saplings randomly recruited among the pre-disturbance community. Second, trajectories relied on <em>true recruits</em> germinated from the seeds bank and selected through competitive exclusion for light favoring acquisitive, light-demandings species. Eventually an inversed balance progressively restored the stochastic recruitment observed in undisturbed forests. Recruitment trajectories ensured both functional an dtaxonomic recovery, thus maintaining communitiesinitial differences. Communities disturbance response was driven by the emergence of deterministic competition processes for light that balanced stochastic processes observed in undisturbed forests. Communities taxonomic and functional characteristics were consistently restored and initial differences among commmunities were maintained. Still, the recovery was decades-long and called cautions regarding the time prescribed for forest recovery.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Determining the response of tropical forests to disturbance is key to predict their fate in the global changing context. In the last decades, tropical forests experienced a wide range of disturbance, from radical land-use changes for agriculture or mining <span class="citation">(Dezécache, Faure, et al. 2017; Dezécache, Salles, et al. 2017)</span> to more insidious changes of communities structure, diversity and functioning following climatic changes <span class="citation">(Aubry-Kientz et al. 2015)</span> or anthropogenic activities like selective logging <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012; Hérault and Gourlet-Fleury 2016)</span>. In that respect a vast litterature successfully modeled communities response to disturbance in terms of tree growth <span class="citation">(Gourlet-Fleury and Houllier 2000)</span>, tree height <span class="citation">(Rutishauser et al. 2016)</span>, carbon, water and nutrient fluxes <span class="citation">(Putz et al. 2012; Martin et al. 2015; Piponiot et al. 2016)</span>. However, similar approaches regarding forest diversity remain hindered by the scarcity of long-term monitoring and by the huge biological diversity imposing to focus on common or commercial species <span class="citation">(Sebbenn et al. 2008; Rozendaal, Soliz-Gamboa, and Zuidema 2010; Vinson et al. 2015)</span>. Trees diversity is a major determinant of forests functioning and productivity, so it is urgent to elucidate its response to disturbance and the underlying mechansisms. The diversity response would assess communities resilience and recovery time, and eventually help adjusting exploitation and conservation guidelines <span class="citation">(Díaz et al. 2005; Gardner et al. 2007; Schwartz, Falkowski, and Peña-Claros 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>Communities response to intense disturbance have been recognized to follow succession models based on changes in resources availability and interactions among species. First, the succession patterns involves already grown saplings that establish under conditions of high light, high nutrient availability and low competition. A second phase sees the tree growth increasing the competition for the space and resources until excluding species with respect to their functional strategy and competitive ability. Eventually a third phase corresponds to the senescence of the first established seedlings and to the emergence of understory species restoring the composition and diversity of pre-disturbance communities. This succession model proved relevant in temperate forests but might be blurried in tropical rainforests by their biodiversity and by tree species rapid vegetative growth <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Denslow2000"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>. Besides the succession model predicts forests trajectories after very intense disturbance or clear cutting, but it might not be as robust in cases of climatic changes or selecive logging where the pre-disturbance communities and their steady-state dynamics still remain. In those cases communities trajectories would depend on both on the dynamics of surviving trees from before disturbance, and on the recruitment of new trees <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>. The recruitment in tropical forests either rely upon stochastic processes driven only by recruitment and dispersal limitations <span class="citation">(Hurtt and Pacala 1995; Hubbell 2001)</span>, or upon deterministic processes driven by niche-based competition and biotic interactions <span class="citation">(Adler, HilleRislambers, and Levine 2007)</span>. Stochastic processes, translating Hubbell’s neutral theory, build communities as random samples of the larger regional-scale forest <span class="citation">(Hubbell 2001; Chave 2004)</span>. In contrast deterministic processes select species with respect to their ecology and competitive ability. The involvment of stochastic and deterministic processes remains debated and post-disturbance trajectories probably result from a gradual balance between them.</p>
<p>Communities are defined by their taxonomic characteristics, that refer to a neutral species assemblages, and by their functional characteristics, that account for species ecology and ecosystem functioning <span class="citation">(Violle et al. 2007; Kunstler et al. 2016)</span>. The ecological processes shaping recruitment trajectories may differently affect communities taxonomic and functional characteristics, and two communities may be very different in terms of taxonomy but very similar in terms of functioning <span class="citation">(Villéger et al. 2012)</span>. The correlations, or not, between taxonomic and functional [??? system] trajectories are therefore insightful of the ecological rules involved in the recruitment processes, specifically to explicit the deterministic processes at stake <span class="citation">(Mayfield and Levine 2010; Fukami et al. 2005)</span>. Competitive interactions among species indeed depend on their functional differences, specifically regarding the use of the limited shared resources, that determine their competitive ability and ecological niche <span class="citation">(Webb et al. 2002; Perronne et al. 2017)</span>. In tropical forests where the light is limiting, communities response to disturbance translate in a shift from slow-growing, long-lived species with “conservative” resource use to fast growing, resource “acquisitive” species <span class="citation">(Denslow 1980; Molino and Sabatier 2001; Bongers et al. 2009)</span>.<br />
The competition processes at stake would be grasped by shifts in key leaf, wood and life-history functional traits assessing species resources acquisition strategy and ecology <span class="citation">(Wright et al. 2004; Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011; Gerhold et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>Beyond the mere understanding of response mechanisms, disentangle deterministic from stochastic processes elucidates the resilience of communities. Controversies remain about whether resilience is either deterministic, entailing the convergence of communities towards stable taxonomic and functional characteritics likely defined by the environment <span class="citation">(Clements 1916)</span>, or stochastic, entailing species stochastic recruitment and communities random divergence <span class="citation">(Diamond 1975)</span>. These contrasting views were reconciled under the hypothesis that communities might diverge in the taxonomic space while they converge in the functional space. Under this hypothesis communities have a determined diversity and composition in functional niches, but this hypothesis remains to be tested in tropical forests.</p>
<p>In this paper we followed the fate of recruited tree diversity and composition (60 121 individuals) over 30 years after a large disturbance gradient, with 10 to 60% of forest biomass removed. We assessed the taxonomic dissimilarity between recruited trees and initial communities, the taxonomic and functional diversity of recruited trees and the corresponding trajectories of functional traits, using a large functional trait database covering the leaf, wood and life-history spectra. We compared the observed trajectories to neutral processes corresponding to the stochastic recruitment of individuals and to the randomization of species functional traits. These trajectories aimed to highlight the recruitment processes underlying forests response to disturbance, specifically assessing (i) the succession pattern and the underlying ecological processes and (ii) clarify the taxonomic and functional facets of forests resilience and their consequences for forest management.</p>
