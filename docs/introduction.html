<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Decades of studies retained demographic processes driving trees recruitment as the main determinant of forest dynamics. As stated by the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH), a high biodiversity in communities would be maintained by the variability of environmental conditions which would favor and enhance the growth of a variety of species along time which makes the recruited trees to be very diverse. Similarly, the high diversity of tropical forests is assumed to be maintained by the tree fall gaps dynamics which impulses a different recruitment regime between enlightened and dyer gaps and shaded, wet undercover areas. Recruitment dynamics are thus crucial to understand, as determinant of the forest-to-be and driver of community assemblage. A large literature investigated forests population dynamics and successfully modeled forest response to disturbance. Based on stands structure observed in the field, these models proved relevant predictors of carbon sequestration, commercial stocks and diameter distribution dynamics in the short and in the long term . Predicting in this way species population recovery and subsequently stands diversity after disturbance however seems tricky as the growth and survival dynamics in the early life stage, far from being well understood, are highly variable among species which makes the recruitment of a tree too infrequent an event and really poorly correlated to the presence of similar species at the time considered. Attempts were successfully conducted to model the regeneration of single species however the response of the whole recruited community after disturbance could not reasonably be assessed via similar methods which would require the combination of accurate knowledge of each species ecology and behavior.</p>
<ul>
<li>Post logging dynamics have been identified but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, and it is interesting because it gives clues on the functioning of forests (which filters are at stake and how they apply on the ecosystems)</li>
<li><p>We were interesting in the successional rate along which recruitment functional diversity varies: do we already see the new generation of functional type selected, compared to mature (old growth) forest</p></li>
<li><p>Do the stand return to initial condition, is the cycle achieved?</p></li>
<li><p>Hypotheses:</p></li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The more intense the logging, the most significant the impact on composition and diversity metrics.</p></li>
<li><p>We expect an increase in the stand diversity (Intermediate disturbance hypothesis) or no change in richness, at least for low logging intensity</p></li>
<li><p>Exploitation would change the functional composition toward more light-demanding strategies</p></li>
<li><p>We expect the diversity to follow a cyclic dynamic, as observed for stands biomass, and the ecosystem functioning to be resilient, at least for low intensity treatment</p></li>
