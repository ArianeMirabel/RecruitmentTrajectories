<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Determining the response of forest communities to disturbance is key to understand the ecological rules shaping tropical forests communtities. This prospect yield a vast literature which successfully defined and modeled the response of key forest features and functions such as carbon sequestration, commercial stocks, and diameter distribution dynamics in the short and in the long term <span class="citation">(Gourlet-Fleury et Houllier 2000; F. E. Putz et al. 2012; Martin et al. 2015; Vidal, West, et Putz 2016)</span>. The response of stand communities diversity, though, has been hindered by both the huge biological diversity of tropical forests and the scarcity of long-term forest monitoring. Even if the post-disturbance dynamics of some species have been determined it usually dealt with some commercial and valuable tree species only as this requires accurate ecological knowledge of the species <span class="citation">(Sebbenn et al. 2008; Vinson et al. 2015)</span>. The overall response of forest communities in terms of taxonomic and functional diversity then remains unclear, so as the underlying ecological rules. Diversity dynamics of tropical forest communities are largely determined by the recruitment dynamics that drive the amount and the species of trees growing and surviving until the adult stage. Recruitment dynamics are defined by the disturbance regime which, in changing the ecosystem biotic and abiotic environment, creates a temporal variability allowing a variety of species to strive in the long term despite the risk of exclusion for resource competition <span class="citation">(Denslow 1980)</span>. This principle underlies the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH) that explains the origin and maintenance of tropical forests biodiversity by the patchy variability of environmental conditions in space and time following climate irregularity, random tree fall gaps, etc. This variability, when not too intense or frequent as to set up strong environmental filters, enlarges the ecological range of species in the community <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino et Sabatier 2001; Bongers et al. 2009)</span> and therefore shapes its taxonomic diversity, vegetative structure, physiology and cycles of carbon, nutrients,and water <span class="citation">(Anderson-Teixeira et al. 2013)</span>. Disturbance in the form of tree fall gaps and consecutive environmental changes already proved to alter the diversity and taxonomic composition of tropical forests communities in prompting some environmental filters selecting species with fast and efficient resource acquisition <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012, Mirabel2018,in prep.)</span>. At the whole plot level the shift towards more acquisitive functional strategies was reflected by functional traits of the leaves (Leaf thickness, toughness, chlorophyll content and specific area) and stem (wood specific gravity and bark thickness) and life traits (maximum hight at adult stage and class of seed mass) <span class="citation">(I. J. Wright et al. 2004; J. Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011)</span>. Within the whole plot dynamics the share hold by the recruitment and mortality processes remains to be determined, first to determine if environmental filters rather enhances species growth and survival or increase others’ mortality, then to explicit the taxonomic and functional structure of the forest being put in place. These questions would resolve the recovery of the stands and debate about the characteristics of the post-disturbance forests-to-be. This would first give some insights into the future conservation or even commercial value of forests according to their composition regarding rare or commercial species <span class="citation">(S Díaz et al. 2005; Gardner et al. 2007; Schwartz, Falkowski, et Peña-Claros 2017)</span>. It could besides elucidate the determinism of tropical forests trajectories that would mean the convergence after disturbance of taxonomic and functional communities towards initial state. Under the convergence perspective the recruitment would be fully nested within the initial inventory and the forests-to-be would more and more resemble the pre-disturbance state <span class="citation">(Meiners et al. 2015; Li et al. 2016)</span>.</p>
<p>In this paper we analysed in a neotropical forest the diversity trajectories of recruited trees over 30 years after a gradient of disturbance, with 10 to 60% of ecosystem biomass removed. We assessed the taxonomic as well as functional diversity of recruited trees, using a large functional traits database browsing major leaf, stem and seed traits and species maximum height We aimed to (i) confirm the role of environmental filters selecting the recruited trees according to their competitivity for resource acquisition, (ii) resolve the convergence of communities and the maintenance of taxonomic composition in the long term, and (iii) determine the resilience of the initial pre-distirbance .</p>
