<p>Trees biodiversity is central for tropical forests functioning and services. In the current climatic and land-use changing context it is urgent to clarify the response of communities diversity and composition to disturbance. In that regard, recruitment processes as major driver of communities trajectories are suited to highlight their response to disturbance and the underlying processes. Recruitment trajectories would allow (i) disentangling neutral, stochastic and deterministic, selective processes they rely on, and (ii) specifying the competition rules involved in species selection, and finally (iii) resolving the duration and the completeness of recruitment processes. We examined the trajectories over 30 years of recruitment diversity and composition in 75 ha of a neotropical forest following a gradient of logging and thinning disturbance (from 15 to 60% of AGB removed). Specifically we analysed and compared to neutral models the recruitment trajectories in taxonomic richness, evennes, and compositional turnover compared to initial communities, and in Rao functional diversity integrating species ecology through 7 key functional traits. We evidenced three recruitment phases shaped by the gradual balance between stochastic and deterministic underlying processes. First, trajectories relied on the growth of saplings randomly recruited among the pre-disturbance community. Second, trajectories relied on <em>true recruits</em> germinated from the seed bank and depending on competitive exclusion processes favoring acquisitive, light-demandings species. Eventually an inversed balance progressively restored the stochastic recruitment observed in mature forests and drove a recovery of initial functioning and taxonomic structure. While the functional recovery of the recruitment was fast, the taxonomic recovery lasted for decades and prevented a complete resilience. Communities disturbance response combined stochastic processes, predominant before disturbance and progressively restored along time, and deterministic competition processes favoring light-demanding species. Although the taoxnomic and functional structure proved resilient, the taxonmic recovery was decades-long and called cautions regarding the time required for forest recovery and the completeness of communities resilience.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Determining the response of tropical forests to disturbance is key to predict their fate in the global changing context. In the last decades, tropical forests experienced a wide range of disturbance, from radical land-use changes for agriculture or mining <span class="citation">(Dezécache, Faure, et al. 2017; Dezécache, Salles, et al. 2017)</span> to more insidious changes of communities structure, diversity and functioning following climatic changes <span class="citation">(Aubry-Kientz et al. 2015)</span> or anthropogenic activities like selective logging <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012; Hérault and Gourlet-Fleury 2016)</span>. In that respect a vast literature successfully modeled communities response to disturbance in terms of tree growth <span class="citation">(Gourlet-Fleury and Houllier 2000)</span>, tree height <span class="citation">(Rutishauser et al. 2016)</span>, carbon, water and nutrient fluxes <span class="citation">(Putz et al. 2012; Martin et al. 2015; Piponiot et al. 2016)</span>. However, similar approaches regarding forest diversity remain hindered by the scarcity of long-term monitoring and by the huge biological diversity constraining the analysis to focus on common or commercial species <span class="citation">(Sebbenn et al. 2008; Rozendaal, Soliz-Gamboa, and Zuidema 2010; Vinson et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>Communities response to disturbance is built upon recruited communities and shaped by the ecological rules at stake. After disturbance the recruitment process is recognized to follow succession models based on different phases of tree growth and establishment. Successive phases depend on changes in interactions among species and resources availability, specifically light in tropical rainforests. After disturbance seedlings first establish under conditions of high light and nutrient availability and low competition. In a second phase, tree growth closes the canopy space and competition increases until excluding less competitive species. A third phase then correspond to the senescence of the seedlings first established and to the emergence and maintenance of understory species restoring the equilibrium of old-growth forests. In tropical rainforests though the succession pattern might be blurried by the high biodiversity and the trees rapid vegetative growth <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Denslow2000"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>. Besides if this pattern has been validated across large environmental and spatial scales these successions models usually applied on clear cutting and secondary forests. In the case of lower disturbance succession models may mitigate with the maintenance regime of old growth forests.</p>
<p>Post-disturbance communities comprise on the one hand the trees surviving from before disturbance and on the other hand those recruited afterward <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>. Surviving trees obviously mirror the diversity and composition of pre-disturbance communities, so the dynamics and the resilience of communities would depend on the diversity of recruited trees. First, recruitment trajectories depend on the composition and diversity of the initial, pre-disturbance community as this conditions the pool of recruitable species via the existing saplings and seeds bank <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>. Trajectories besides depend on recruitment processes, either stochastic and driven only by recruitment and dispersal limitations <span class="citation">(Hurtt and Pacala 1995; Hubbell 2001)</span>, or deterministic and driven by niche-based competition and biotic interaction <span class="citation">(Adler, HilleRislambers, and Levine 2007)</span>. Stochastic processes, translating Hubbell’s neutral theory, build communities as random samples of the larger regional-scale forest <span class="citation">(Hubbell 2001; Chave 2004)</span>. Deterministic processes in turn rely at the spatial scale on the species interactions with abiotic environment that filter-out recruited species. Consequently, understanding the ecological mechanisms underlying communities trajectories first meant estimating the importance of the initial taxonomic composition and second to explicit the balance between stochastic and deterministic processes. Focusing on the recruitment processes would thus shed light on the resilience of communities and on the time needed to recover the pre-disturbance ecosystem properties, and eventually help adjusting exploitation and conservation guidelines <span class="citation">(Díaz et al. 2005; Gardner et al. 2007; Schwartz, Falkowski, and Peña-Claros 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>Communities are defined by their taxonomic structure, that refers to a neutral assemblage of species composition and diversity, and by their functional structure, that accounts for species ecology and ecosystem functioning <span class="citation">(Violle et al. 2007; Kunstler et al. 2016)</span>. The ecological processes shaping recruitment trajectories may differently affect their taxonomic and their functional structure, and two communities may be very different in terms of taxonomic diversity but very similar in terms of diversity and composition of functional traits <span class="citation">(Villéger et al. 2012)</span>. The correlations, or not, between taxonomic and functional system trajectories are therefore insightful of the ecological rules involved in the recruitment processes, specifically to explicit the deterministic processes at stake <span class="citation">(Mayfield and Levine 2010; Fukami et al. 2005)</span>. Competitive interactions among species are indeed determined by their differences in competitive ability and ecological niche and therefore depend their functional differences, specifically regarding the use of the limited shared resources <span class="citation">(Webb et al. 2002; Perronne et al. 2017)</span>. In tropical forests where the light is limiting, communities response to disturbance translate in a shift from slow-growing, long-lived species with “conservative” resource use to fast growing, resource “acquisitive” species <span class="citation">(Denslow 1980; Molino and Sabatier 2001; Bongers et al. 2009)</span>.<br />
The competition processes at stake would be grasped by shifts in key leaf, wood and life-history functional traits assessing species resources acquisition strategy and ecology <span class="citation">(Wright et al. 2004; Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011; Gerhold et al. 2015)</span>. <span class="citation">(Chesson 2000)</span> defines two types of competitive processes interplaying in communities maintenance, either <em>equalizing</em> and decreasing the differences in species fitness or <em>stabilizing</em> favoring species coexistence in limiting the amount of shared resources. Equalizing mechanisms drive the most competitive species to dominance and the least competitive to exclusion and decrease the functional diversity of the community. Stabilizing competiton would mitigate the species competitive exclsion in decreasing the functional overlap among species, limit the species abundance through intraspecific competition and increase the functional diversity of the community <span class="citation">(Ackerly 2003; McGill et al. 2006; Kunstler et al. 2012)</span>.</p>
<p>Beyond the mere understanding of response mechanisms, disentangle deterministic from stochastic processes insights the tenants of communities resilience. Controversies remain about whether resilience is deterministic, and thus entails the convergence of communities towards a given, stable, structure likely defined by the environment <span class="citation">(Clements 1916)</span>, or stochastic, and thus entails species random recruitment and the divergence of communities <span class="citation">(Diamond 1975)</span>. These contrasting views were reconciled under the hypothesis that communities diverge in the taxonomic space while they converge in the functional space. Under this hypothesis communities have a determined diversity and composition in functional niches, but this hypothesis remains to be tested in tropical forest.</p>
<p>In this paper we followed the fate of recruited tree diversity and composition (60 121 individuals) over 30 years after a large disturbance gradient, with 10 to 60% of forest biomass removed. We assessed the taxonomic dissimilarity between recruited trees and initial communities, the taxonomic and functional diversity of recruited trees and the corresponding trajectories of functional traits, using a large functional trait database covering the leaf, wood and life-history spectra. We compared the observed trajectories to neutral processes corresponding to the stochastic recruitment of individuals and to the randomization of species functional traits. These trajectories aimed to highlight the recruitment processes underlying forests response to disturbance, specifically assessing (i) the role of deterministic compared to stochastic processes, (ii) determine the competition processes involved, and eventually (iii) clarify the taxonomic and functional facets of forests resilience and their consequences for forest management.</p>
