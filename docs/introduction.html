<p>Trees biodiversity is central for tropical forests functioning and services. In the current climatic and land-use changing context it is urgent to clarify the response of communities diversity and composition to disturbance. Recruitment as major driver of forests trajectories is crucial in that regard to highlight the underlying processes of forests response. Through recruitment trajectories, clarify forests resilience and recovery would come to (i) unravel the stochastic from deterministic recruitment processes and (ii) specify the deterministic competition rules involved in species selection, and finally (iii) resolve the time to recover pre-disturbance recruitment processes and the completeness of their resilience. We examined the trajectories of recruitment diversity and composition in 70ha of a neotropical forest over 30 years after a gradient of logging and thinning disturbance (from 15 to 60% of AGB removed). Specifically we analysed the trajectories of three taxonomic diversities assessing communities richness and evennes, of Rao functional diversity integrating species ecology through 7 key functional traits, and of the species turnover of recruited trees compared to pre-disturbance communities. Recruitment trajectories were besides compared to null models of stochastic taxonomic and functional recruitment. We found three-phased recruitment trajectories shaped by the gradual balance between stochastic and deterministic processes. Trajectories first relied on the stochastic recruitment of pre-disturbance grown saplings. Then it relied on the deterministic recruitment of <em>true recruits</em> from the seed bank undergoing competitive exclusion favoring acquisitive, light-demandings species. In a third phase an inversed balance restored the stochastic recruitment observed in mature forests and marked a return to communities initial states. Recruitment trajectories entailed a fast recovery of the functional diversity but a slower taxonomic recovery still unachieved although it maintained composition differencies among plots. The response to disturbance is a combination of deterministic and stochastic processes, first altering recruits diversity and composition in favoring light-demanding species, and then restoring pre-disturbance taxonomic and functional structure through stochastic recruitment processes. Both of the recruitment proved resilient, although the species composition of pre-disturbance communities remained unachieved. Still, after 30 years recruits’ composition remained alter so if promising for the maintenance of the multiple facets of forests biodiversity, these results called cautions regarding the necessary time for forest recovery and the resonse of repeated disturbance.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Determining the response of tropical forests to disturbance is key to predict their fate in the global changing context. In the last decades, tropical forests experienced a wide range of disturbance, from radical land-use changes for agriculture or mining <span class="citation">(Dezecache et al. 2017; Dezécache et al. 2017)</span> to more insidious changes of communities structure, diversity and functioning following climatic changes <span class="citation">(M. Aubry-Kientz et al. 2015)</span> or anthropogenic activities like selective logging <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012; Hérault and Gourlet-Fleury 2016)</span>. In that respect a vast literature successfully modeled communities response to disturbance in terms of tree growth <span class="citation">(Gourlet-Fleury and Houllier 2000)</span>, tree height <span class="citation">(Rutishauser et al. 2016)</span>, carbon stocks and water and nutrient fluxes <span class="citation">(F. E. Putz et al. 2012; Martin et al. 2015; Piponiot et al. 2016)</span>. However, similar approaches regarding forest diversity remain hindered the scarcity of long-term monitoring and by the huge biological diversity that constrain the analysis to focus on common or commercial species <span class="citation">(Sebbenn et al. 2008; Rozendaal, Soliz-Gamboa, and Zuidema 2010; Vinson et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>Major insights on the response of forests diversity to disturbance and the underlying ecological processes would be given by the trajectories of tree communities along time. The structuring effects of determinant processes though might confound at the scale of the whole community <span class="citation">(Jerôme Chave 2004)</span> and would be clarified by decomposing the communities according to underlying demographic processes. Communities comprise on the one hand the trees surviving from before disturbance and on the other hand those recruited afterward <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>. Surviving trees already proved to mirror the diversity and composition of pre-disturbance communities, so the dynamics and the resilience of communities would depend on the diversity of recruited trees. First, recruitment trajectories depend on the composition and diversity of the initial, pre-disturbance community as this conditions the pool of recruitable species via the existing saplings and seed bank <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>. Trajectories besides depend on recruitment processes, either stochastic and driven by recruitment and dispersal limitations <span class="citation">(Hurtt and Pacala 1995; Stephen P. Hubbell 2001)</span>, or deterministic and driven by niche-based competition or biotic interaction <span class="citation">(Adler, HilleRislambers, and Levine 2007)</span>. Stochastic processes, translating Hubbell’s neutral theory, build communities as random samples of the larger regional-scale forest <span class="citation">(Stephen P. Hubbell 2001; Jerôme Chave 2004)</span>. Deterministic processes in turn rely at this spatial scale on the interactions among species and with abiotic environment that filter-out recruited species following their ecology. Understand the mechanisms of communities trajectories first comes to estimate the importance of the initial taxonomic composition and second to explicit the balance between stochastic and deterministic processes. Recruitment processes would then shed light on the resilience of communities and on the time before recovering the pre-disturbance ecosystem properties, and eventually help adjusting exploitation and conservation guidelines <span class="citation">(S Díaz et al. 2005; Gardner et al. 2007; Schwartz, Falkowski, and Peña-Claros 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>The recruitment processes shaping the trajectories differently affect communities taxonomic structure, refering to species composition and diversity, and functional structure, accounting for species ecology and functioning <span class="citation">(Violle et al. 2007; Kunstler et al. 2016)</span>. Two communities may indeed be very different in terms of taxonomic diversity but very similar in terms of functional traits and functioning <span class="citation">(Villéger et al. 2012)</span>. The differences between taxonomic and functional trajectories are therefore insightful of the recruitment rules involved, specifically regarding the deterministic processes and their strength <span class="citation">(Mayfield and Levine 2010; Fukami et al. 2005)</span>. At this local spatial scale, deterministic processes rely on competitive interactions among trees determined by their functional differences regarding the use of limited shared resources <span class="citation">(Webb et al. 2002; Perronne et al. 2017)</span>. The competitive interactions among species are a balance between their differences in competitive ability and ecological niche. Differences in competitive ability drive the most competitive species to dominance and the least competitive to elimination, and thus decrease the functional diversity of the community. Niche differences in turn favor low densities and low similarity among species, and thus increase the functional diversity <span class="citation">(Ackerly 2003; McGill et al. 2006; Kunstler et al. 2012)</span>. In tropical forests where the light is limiting, communities response to disturbance translate in a shift from slow-growing, long-lived species with “conservative” resource use to fast growing, resource “acquisitive” species <span class="citation">(Denslow 1980; J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001; Bongers et al. 2009)</span>.<br />
The competition processes at stake would therefore be grasp by shifts in key leaf, wood and life-history functional traits assessing species resources acquisition strategy and ecology <span class="citation">(I. J. Wright et al. 2004; Jerome Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011; Gerhold et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>Beyond the mere understanding of response mechanisms, disentangle deterministic from stochastic processes insights the tenants of communities resilience. Controversies remain about whether resilience is determinisitc, and thus entails the convergence of communities towards a given structure likely defined by the environment <span class="citation">(Clements 1916)</span>, or stochastic, thus entailing communities divergence through species random recruitment <span class="citation">(Diamond 1975)</span>. Both points of view were reconciled under the hypothesis that communities diverge in the taxonomic space while they converge in the functional space and therefore have determined diversity and composition in functional niches, but this hypothesis remains to be tested in tropical forest.</p>
<p>In this paper we followed the fate of recruited tree communities (60 121 individuals) over 30 years on a large disturbance gradient, with 15 to 60% of forest biomass removed. We assessed the taxonomic and functional diversity of recruited trees and associated traits trajectories, using a large functional trait database covering the leaf, wood and life-history spectra. We besides followed the dissimilarity in composition of recruited trees compared to the initial communities. Eventually we compared the observed trajectories to a stochastic recruitment entailing a random sampling of recruited recruits and the randomization of their functional traits. These trajectories aimed to highlight the recruitment processes underlying forests response to disturbance, specifically assessing (i) the role of deterministic compared to stochastic processes and (ii) the competition deterministic processes invovled. Recruitment trajectories eventually (iii) enlightened the taxonomic and functional facets of forests resilience and there consequences for forest management.</p>
