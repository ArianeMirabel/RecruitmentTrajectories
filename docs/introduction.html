The role of tree diversity for tropical forests functioning and services makes it crucial tree diversity and composition fate in the global changing context. Community long-term response to disturbance rely on tree recruitment, long seen as following deterministic successional pathways. These pathways however might be altered in the hyper-diverse tropical forests and of slight but recurrent disturbances induced by global changes. Post-disturbance recruitment trajectories would (i) disentangle the determinants of tree recruitment between stochastic and deterministic processes that enhance a restricted pool of species, and (ii) elucidate tropical forests taxonomic and functional resilience. We examined the trajectories over 30 years of recruited trees taxonomic and functional diversity in 12 plots of 6.25 ha of forest following a disturbance gradient. We analyzed taxonomic richness, evenness, and turnover, and functional diversity and composition (regarding 7 leaf, stem and life-history functional traits). We revealed a three-phased successional pathway defined by the interplay of stochastic and deterministic recruitment processes. The succession translated into (i) saplings growth maintaining pre-disturbance community diversity and composition, (ii) light-demanding species enhanced recruitment entailing, above a disturbance intensity threshold, the dominance of pioneers and (iii) the recovery of pre-disturbance taxonomic and functional characteristics and of stochastic recruitment processes. Although tangible, community taxonomic and functional resilience was decades-long. Post-disturbance recruitment relied on deterministic competition processes for light balancing the stochastic processes ruling undisturbed communities. Although resilient, recruitment taxonomic and functional characteristics remained altered in the long-term, calling caution for forest management.

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p> Determining the response of tropical forests to disturbance is key to predict their fate in the global changing context. In the last decades, tropical forests experienced a wide range of disturbance, from radical land-use changes for agriculture or mining <span class="citation">(Dezécache, Faure, et al. 2017; Dezécache, Salles, et al. 2017)</span> to more insidious changes following climatic changes or anthropogenic activities like selective logging <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012; Aubry-Kientz et al. 2015)</span>. In that respect a vast literature successfully modeled community response to disturbance in terms of tree growth, tree height and fluxes of carbon, water, and nutrients <span class="citation">(Gourlet-Fleury and Houllier 2000; Putz et al. 2012; Piponiot et al. 2016; Rutishauser et al. 2016)</span>. In terms of tree community diversity and composition, the ecological theory of succession assumes post-disturbance pathways driven by a succession of deterministic recruitment processes. These pathways would track the post-disturbance variations in resource availability, that imply a succession of recruitment processes depending on species resource use and competitive abilities <span class="citation">(Clements 1916; Meiners et al. 2015)</span>. The theory assumes that the deterministic succession shaped predictable trajectories gradually restoring communities pre-disturbance states <span class="citation">(Chesson 2000; Rees et al. 2001; Adler, HilleRislambers, and Levine 2007)</span>. Specifically, in forest ecosystem, tree species community succession first comprises the recruitment of saplings benefiting from higher resources availability and lower competition. Then, stand maturation progressively enforces the exclusion of low-competitive species until the senescence of early-successional species, and the emergence of late-successional ones leading to the recovery of pre-disturbance composition and diversity <span class="citation">(Denslow and Guzman 2000)</span>. Empirical evidence, however, often show post-disturbance trajectories deviating from the predictable succession and resulting from an interplay of deterministic and stochastic recruitment processes. Post-disturbance trajectories would then also rely on stochastic processes, like dispersal limitations, and thus lead to new equilibrium states instead of recovering towards the pre-disturbance state <span class="citation">(Hubbell 2001; Chave 2004; Norden et al. 2015)</span>. Hence, the question is to determine the balance between deterministic and stochastic recruitment processes. In the hyper-diverse tropical forests, this balance is specifically debated. While several studies revealed predictable and homogeneous successional patterns restoring the pre-disturbance community <span class="citation">(Norden et al. 2009; Letcher et al. 2015)</span>, others showed diverging trajectories following disturbance and different equilibrium state <span class="citation">(Longworth et al. 2014; Norden et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>Post-disturbance trajectories may correspond either to recruited trees taxonomic characteristics, that refer to neutral species assemblages, or to functional characteristics, that account for species ecology and functioning <span class="citation">(MacArthur and Levins 1967; Violle et al. 2007; Kunstler et al. 2016)</span>. Deterministic processes correspond to a recruitment depending on species competitive ability determined by their functional characteristics <span class="citation">(Rees et al. 2001; Perronne et al. 2017)</span>. Resulting recruitment trajectories would be similar among communities. Specifically, as light is the limiting resource in tropical forests, deterministic processes would drive a functional succession from fast-growing species with “acquisitive” resource use, able of important and fast light acquisition, to slow-growing, long-lived species with “conservative” resource use <span class="citation">(Denslow 1980; Molino and Sabatier 2001; Bongers et al. 2009)</span>.<br />
Key leaf, wood and life-history functional traits assessing species resources acquisition strategy and ecology would thus allow grasping the deterministic processes involved in post-disturbance trajectories <span class="citation">(Wright et al. 2004; Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011)</span>. Stochastic processes, in turn, correspond to a random species recruitment independant of their taxonomic identity and functional characteristics, and imply trajectories diverging among communities. Because of the high diversity and functional redundancy in tropical forests, tree community taxonomic trajectories may not track functional ones. The combination of taxonomic and functional approaches is then necessary to identify the different recruitment processes involved <span class="citation">(Fukami et al. 2005; Chalmandrier et al. 2015; Cequinel et al. 2018)</span> and to conclude about the recovery of pre-disturbance community <span class="citation">(Clements 1916; Diamond 1975)</span>.</p>
<p>Here, we followed recruitment trajectories over 30 years of 75 ha cumulated area of Neotropical forest plots set up on a gradient of disturbance intensity, from 10 to 60% of aboveground standing biomass removed. We examined recruited trees taxonomic composition, richness, and evenness, taxonomic turnover compared to pre-disturbance community, and functional composition and diversity based on seven major leaf, stem, and life-history traits. We compared the recruitment trajectories to neutral models corresponding to a stochastic recruitment and a randomization of species functional traits. Specifically, we (i) elucidated the successional pathway shaping community response to disturbance and the underlying ecological processes, and (ii) clarified the extent of community taxonomic and functional resilience, in the sense of pre-disturbance characteristics recovery, and its consequences for tropical forest management.</p>
