<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Determining the response of tropical forests to disturbance is a key to predict their fate in a global change context where disturbance are expected to become more and more frequent. Tropical forests indeed currently experience a wide range of disturbance, from radical land-use changes for agriculture or mining <span class="citation">(Dezecache et al. 2017; Dezécache et al. 2017)</span> to insidious changes in communities structure and functioning following changes in the precipitation regime or after selective logging <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012; Hérault and Gourlet-Fleury 2016)</span>. In that respect a vast literature successfully modeled the response of tropical forests structure, carbon stocks and fluxes to anthropogenic and natural disturbances <span class="citation">(Gourlet-Fleury and Houllier 2000; F. E. Putz et al. 2012; P. A. Martin et al. 2015; Piponiot et al. 2016)</span>. Regarding diversity, however, similar attempts have been hindered by both the huge biological diversity and the scarcity of long-term monitoring. If the response to disturbance has been identified for common species assemblages, it usually remained confined to few commercial and valuable species <span class="citation">(Sebbenn et al. 2008; Rozendaal, Soliz-Gamboa, and Zuidema 2010; Vinson et al. 2015)</span>. Forests communities functioning and dynamics, though, result from the constantly evolving interactions and feedbacks among trees and their environment and they would only be assessed through the study of entire communities <span class="citation">(Avila et al. 2016; Liang et al. 2016)</span>. Forests response to disturbance is build on the the population of disturbance survivors and the recruitment of new individuals. The latter proved to mirror the composition of pre-disturbance forest <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span> so the response of the whole community will be driven by the diversity and composition of the recruitment. Recruitment trajectories, directly determining the community to be, are then key to elucidate the future of tropical forest in the changing global environment.</p>
<p>Recruitment diversity and composition trajectories elucidate the resilience of hyperdiverse tropical forest ecosystems and highlight the determinants of their response after disturbance. To our opinion taxonomic and functional trajectories would depend on the composition and diversity of initial community, partly conditioning the pool of recruited species. Thereafter, the commmunities composition will in turn influence the assembly rules giverning further recruitment and result in a self-perpetuated trajectory along time <span class="citation">(Kunstler et al. 2016)</span>. Similar reasoning apply to both taxonomic and functional trajectories, although given the possible decoupling between taxonomic and functional characteristics in a community their respective trajectories might differ <span class="citation">(Fukami et al. 2005)</span>. The dependency of communties trajectories upon their initial state besides brings the question of its resilience, meaning the convergence of communities towards pre-disturbance conditions and the maintenance of the initial differences among communities <span class="citation">(S Díaz et al. 2005; Gardner et al. 2007; Schwartz, Falkowski, and Peña-Claros 2017)</span>. In addition to those intrinsinc communities parameters, the recruitment results from the interplay of external processes either stochastic, like random dispersal, recruitment and death <span class="citation">(Stephen P. Hubbell 2001)</span>, or deterministic like niche-based competition processes <span class="citation">(Adler, HilleRislambers, and Levine 2007)</span>. While stochastic processes would build communities as random samples of larger, regional ones, deterministic processes rely on the abiotic environment and filter-out recruited species according to their ecology. Specifically, species would be selected through their tolerance to stress or competition for resources. Based on the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH) these deterministic processes and the patchy variability of environmental conditions in space and time maintain a large ecological range in the community via the species selected under past environmental conditions <span class="citation">(Guitet et al. 2018)</span>. In tropical forests deterministic processes depend on the strategy of resource use, specifically light, and therefore result in shifts from fast growing, resources-acquisitive but stress-intolerant species favored in disturbance gaps, to slow-growing, stress-tolerant and resource-conservative species dominating in mature forests <span class="citation">(Denslow 1980; J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001; Bongers et al. 2009)</span>. Communities functional diversity would then be driven either by selective pressures filtering-out some functional strategies or by the competitive exclusion for resources limiting the functional similarity among species <span class="citation">(Ackerly 2003; McGill et al. 2006)</span>. It would be translated by either the overdispersion or the restriction of leaf and stem functional traits (leaf thickness, toughness, chlorophyll content and specific area; wood specific gravity and bark thickness) and life-history traits (maximum height at adult stage and class of seed mass) <span class="citation">(I. J. Wright et al. 2004; J. Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>Empirical tests of those mechanisms, the validation of the IDH in tropical rainforests, and the resilience of communities proved hard to succeed and yielded controversial results <span class="citation">(S P Hubbell et al. 1999; J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001; Sheil and Burslem 2003)</span>. In this paper we follow the fate of a recruited tree communities (60121 individuals) over 30 years on a disturbance gradient, with 10 to 60% of forest biomass removed. We assessed the taxonomic as well as functional diversity of recruited trees, using a large functional trait database covering the leaf, wood and life-history spectra. We compared the observed trajectories to null models representing random trees recruitment and randomized functional traits. We aimed to (i) assess the role of deterministic processes compared to stochastic recruitment after disturbance, (ii) assess the taxonomic and functional convergence of forest communities and the maintenance of taxonomic composition in the long term, and (iii) determine the resilience of the ecosystem.</p>
