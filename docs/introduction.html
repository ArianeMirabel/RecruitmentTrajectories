The role of tree diversity for tropical forests functioning and services makes it crucial tree diversity and composition fate in the global changing context. Community long-term response to disturbance rely on tree recruitment, long seen as following deterministic successional pathways. These pathways however might be altered in the hyper-diverse tropical forests and of slight but recurrent disturbances induced by global changes. Post-disturbance recruitment trajectories would (i) disentangle the determinants of tree recruitment between stochastic and deterministic processes that enhance a restricted pool of species, and (ii) elucidate tropical forests taxonomic and functional resilience. We examined the trajectories over 30 years of recruited trees taxonomic and functional diversity in 12 plots of 6.25 ha of forest following a disturbance gradient. We analyzed taxonomic richness, evenness, and turnover, and functional diversity and composition (regarding 7 leaf, stem and life-history functional traits). We highlighted a three-phased successional pathway defined by the interplay of stochastic and deterministic recruitment processes. The succession translated into (i) saplings growth mirroring pre-disturbance communities, (ii) light-demanding species enhanced recruitment entailing, above a disturbance intensity threshold, the dominance of pioneers and (iii) the recovery of pre-disturbance taxonomic and functional characteristics and of stochastic recruitment processes. Although tangible, community taxonomic and functional resilience was decades-long. Post-disturbance recruitment relied on deterministic competition processes for light balancing the stochastic processes ruling undisturbed communities. Although resilient, recruitment taxonomic and functional characteristics remained altered in the long-term, calling caution for forest management.

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Determining the response of tropical forests to disturbance is key to predict their fate in the global changing context. In the last decades, tropical forests experienced a wide range of disturbance, from radical land-use changes for agriculture or mining <span class="citation">(Dezécache, Faure, et al. 2017; Dezécache, Salles, et al. 2017)</span> to more insidious changes following climatic changes or anthropogenic activities like selective logging <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012; Aubry-Kientz et al. 2015)</span>. In that respect a vast literature successfully modeled community response to disturbance in terms of tree growth, tree height and fluxes of carbon, water and nutrients <span class="citation">(Gourlet-Fleury and Houllier 2000; Putz et al. 2012; Piponiot et al. 2016; Rutishauser et al. 2016)</span>. Regarding tree community diversity and composition, the ecological theory of succession assumes that disturbance initiates a suit of deterministic recruitment processes. The different processes depend on the variability of species resource use and competitive abilities <span class="citation">(Clements 1916; Meiners et al. 2015)</span>, and their succession shape predictable trajectories corresponding to a gradual recovery of the pre-disturbance communities <span class="citation">(Chesson 2000; Rees et al. 2001; Adler, HilleRislambers, and Levine 2007)</span>. Specifically in forest ecosystem, the successional framework comprises first the recruitment of saplings benefiting from the available resources and the low competition. Then, stand maturation implies the progressive exclusion of low-competitive species until the senescence of early-successional species and the emergence of late-successional, which restore the pre-disturbance state <span class="citation">(Denslow and Guzman 2000)</span>. Empirical evidence, however, show that post-disturbance trajectories often deviate from the predicted successional pattern and result from an interplay of deterministic processes with stochastic ones. Post-disturbance trajectories would also depend on random processes, like dispersal limitations, and different equilibrium state may be restored after disturbance <span class="citation">(Hubbell 2001; Chave 2004; Norden et al. 2015)</span>. The issue to tackle is determining the balance between deterministic and stochastic processes. This balance remains specifically debated in the highly diverse tropical forests, where several studies highlighted predictable and homogeneous successional patterns restoring pre-disturbance communities <span class="citation">(Norden et al. 2009; Letcher et al. 2015)</span>, while other showed diverging trajectories following disturbance and different equilibrium state <span class="citation">(Longworth et al. 2014; Norden et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>Recruitment processes impact both community taxonomic characteristics (that refer to neutral species assemblages) and functional characteristics (that account for species ecology and functioning) <span class="citation">(MacArthur and Levins 1967; Violle et al. 2007; Kunstler et al. 2016)</span>. A joint analysis of community taxonomic and functional characteristics would then highlight the successive processes underlying post-disturbance trajectories <span class="citation">(Fukami et al. 2005; Chalmandrier et al. 2015; Cequinel et al. 2018)</span>. Stochastic processes would correspond to a random recruitment of species independant of their functional characteristics, and result in diverging trajectories among communities. Determinisitic processes to the contrary would translate into predictable recruitment trajectories driven by a succession of processes based on species competitive ability <span class="citation">(Rees et al. 2001; Perronne et al. 2017)</span>. As light is the limiting resource in tropical forests, deterministic trajectories would correspond to a functional gradient from fast-growing species with “acquisitive” resource use, able of important and fast acquisition of resources, to slow-growing, long-lived species with “conservative” resource use <span class="citation">(Denslow 1980; Molino and Sabatier 2001; Bongers et al. 2009)</span>.<br />
Key leaf, wood and life-history functional traits assessing species resources acquisition strategy and ecology would then grasp the competition processes at stake <span class="citation">(Wright et al. 2004; Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011)</span>. Post-disturbance recruitment processes besides determine community recovery and the restoration of pre-disturbance community <span class="citation">(Clements 1916; Diamond 1975)</span>.</p>
<p>In this paper we followed recruitment trajectories over 30 years of 75 ha cumulated area of Neotropical forest plots set up on a gradient of disturbance intensity, from 10 to 60% of aboveground standing biomass removed. We examined the recruited trees (i) taxonomic composition, richness and evenness, (ii) taxonomic turnover compared to pre-disturbance community, and (iii) functional composition and diversity based on seven major leaf, stem and life-history traits. We compared the recruitment trajectories to neutral models corresponding to a stochastic recruitment and a randomization of species functional traits. Specifically, we (i) elucidated the successional pathway shaping community response to disturbance and the underlying ecological processes and (ii) clarified the extent of community taxonomic and functional resilience, in the sense of pre-disturbance characteristics recovery, and its consequences for tropical forest management.</p>
