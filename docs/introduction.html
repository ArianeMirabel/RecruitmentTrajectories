<p>Trees biodiversity is central for tropical forests functioning and services. In the global change context it is urgent to clarify the response of community diversity and composition to disturbance. Community response to disturbance rely on tree recruitment that is recognized to follow deterministic successional pathways. These however might be altered by the high diversity tropical forests and might not pply in cases of insiduous global changes. Examine post-disturbance recruitment trajectories would (i) disentangle stochastic and deterministic, selective recruitment processes underlying post-disturbance community response, and (ii) elucidate the taxonomic and functional resilience pf tropical forests. We examined the trajectories over 30 years of recruited trees taxonomic and functional diversity in 75 ha of a neotropical forest following a disturbance gradient. Specifically, we analysed recruited trees taxonomic richness, evennes, and compositional turnover and their functional diversity and composition regarding 7 leaf, stem and life-history functional traits. We highlighted a three-phase deterministic successional pathway defined by the interplay of stochastic and deterministic recruitment processes. The successional pathway translated into (i) the growth of saplings mirroring the pre-disturbance community, (ii) the selective recruitment of light-demanding species entailing a high dominance of pioneers above an disturbance intensity threshold, and (iii) a return towards pre-disturbance taxonomic and functional characteristics with the recovery of stochastic recruitment processes. Both recuited trees functional and taxonomic characteristic seemed resilient, but the recovery time proved decades-long. Community recruitment response to disturbance was driven by the emergence of deterministic competition processes for light balancing the stochastic processes rueling undisturbed communities. Recruitment taxonomic and functional characteristics seemed resilient but remained altered in the long-term which called cautions regarding forest management practices.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Determining the response of tropical forests to disturbance is key to predict their fate in the global changing context. In the last decades, tropical forests experienced a wide range of disturbance, from radical land-use changes for agriculture or mining <span class="citation">(Dezécache, Faure, et al. 2017; Dezécache, Salles, et al. 2017)</span> to more insidious changes of communities structure, diversity and functioning following climatic changes <span class="citation">(Aubry-Kientz et al. 2015)</span> or anthropogenic activities like selective logging <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span>. In that respect a vast litterature successfully modeled communities response to disturbance in terms of tree growth, tree height and fluxes of carbon, water and nutrient <span class="citation">(Gourlet-Fleury and Houllier 2000; “Sustaining conservation values in selectively logged tropical forests: the attained and the attainable” 2012; Martin et al. 2015; Piponiot et al. 2016; Rutishauser et al. 2016)</span>. Similar approaches regarding forest diversity and composition remain hindered by the scarcity of long-term monitoring and by studies restriction to common or commercial species imposed by forest huge biological diversity <span class="citation">(Sebbenn et al. 2008; Rozendaal, Soliz-Gamboa, and Zuidema 2010; Vinson et al. 2015)</span>. The recovery of community diversity and composition after disturbance is determined by recruitment processes, thus post-disturbance trajectories would help adjusting exploitation and conservation guidelines <span class="citation">(Díaz et al. 2005; Gardner et al. 2007; Schwartz, Falkowski, and Peña-Claros 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>The traditional view of community response to disturbance relies on successional vegetation models <span class="citation">(Clements 1916)</span> based on changes in resources availability and interactions among species. Adapted to forest ecosystems the successional framework translates into <span class="citation">(Denslow and Guzman 2000)</span> (i) the recruitement of pre-disturbance surviving saplings benefiting from the high resources availability and low competition, (ii) the progressive exclusion of species with low competitive ability because of the increase of competition for resources following stand maturation and (iii) the recovery of pre-disturbance composition and diversity due to the senescence of early-successional pioneers and the emergence of late-succesional species. This highly-deterministic successional pathway proved relevant in temperate forests but remain questioned in tropical rainforests <span class="citation">(Norden et al. 2015)</span>. Indeed, the classical successional pathway may be altered by the huge biological diversity of tropical rainforests and their high functional redundancy leading up to more stochatic processes. Moreover, the successional pathway proved well-adapted to system trajectories following clear cutting or very intense disturbance, but it might be less robust following more insidious global changes. In those cases, community trajectories would depend on the interplay between the stochastic processes, driven by recruitment and dispersal limitations <span class="citation">(Hurtt and Pacala 1995; Hubbell 2001)</span>, and deterministic processes, driven by niche-based competition and biotic interactions <span class="citation">(Adler, HilleRislambers, and Levine 2007)</span>. Stochastic processes, in the neutral theory spirit, build recruited communities as random samples of the surrounding communities <span class="citation">(Hubbell 2001; Chave 2004)</span>. In contrast under deterministic processes, species are selected with respect to their ecological strategies and competitive ability. The relative importance of stochastic and deterministic processes in shaping the post-disturbance trajectories would also change with time as the pre-disturbance environmental conditions are progressively restored.</p>
<p>The processes shaping recruitment trajectories may differently affect communities taxonomic characteristics, that refer to neutral species assemblages, and functional characteristics, that account for species ecology and ecosystem functioning <span class="citation">(Violle et al. 2007; Kunstler et al. 2016)</span>. The correlations, or not, between community taxonomic and functional trajectories are therefore insightful of the processes underlying species recruitment <span class="citation">(Mayfield and Levine 2010; Villéger et al. 2012; Fukami et al. 2005)</span>. Competitive interactions among species indeed depend on their competitive ability and ecological niche, defined by their functional differences regarding the use of limited shared resources <span class="citation">(Webb et al. 2002; Perronne et al. 2017)</span>. In tropical forests where light is the limiting resource, community response to disturbance is a shift from slow-growing, long-lived species with “conservative” resource use, to fast-growing species with “acquisitive” resource use <span class="citation">(Denslow 1980; Molino and Sabatier 2001; Bongers et al. 2009)</span>.<br />
The competition processes at stake would be grasped by shifts in key leaf, wood and life-history functional traits assessing species resources acquisition strategy and ecology <span class="citation">(Wright et al. 2004; Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011; Gerhold et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>The determinism of post-disturbance recruitment further elucidates the random divergence of post-disturbance trajectories, or their convergence towards stable taxonomic and functional characteritics, likely defined by the environment <span class="citation">(Clements 1916; Diamond 1975)</span>. Both views were reconciled under the hypothesis that communities might diverge in the taxonomic space, and have different taxonomic composition and diversity, while they converge in the functional space, but this remains to be tested <span class="citation">(Fukami et al. 2005; Li and Shipley 2018)</span>.</p>
<p>In this paper we followed recruitment trajectories over 30 years of 75 ha of neotropical forest plots set up on a gradient of disturbance intensity, from 10 to 60% of forest biomass removed. We examined the recruited trees (i) taxonomic composition, richness and evenness, (ii) taxonomic turnover compared to pre-disturbance community, and (iii) functional composition and diversity based on seven major leaf, stem and life-history traits. We compared the recruitment trajectories to neutral models corresponding to a stochastic recruitment and a randomization of species functional traits. Specifically, we (i) elucidated the successional pathway shaping community response to disturbance and the underlying ecological processes and (ii) clarified the extent of community taxonomic and functoinal resilience and their consequences for forest management..</p>
