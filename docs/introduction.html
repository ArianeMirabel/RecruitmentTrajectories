<p>The role of trees biodiversity for tropical forests environmental, economic and social service promt to clarify its fate in the global changing climate. We examined trees diversity and composition trajectories in a neotropical forest over 30 years after a gradient of logging and thinning disturbance, by focusing on recruitment processes that drive communities response to disturbance and determine the various facets their resilience. Specifically we analysed the trajectories of three diversities assessing communities taxonomic richness and evennes, of Rao functional diversity intergrating species ecology through 7 key functional traits, and of the recruitment taxonomic turnover compared to pre-disturbance communities. Observed trajectories were besides compared to null models of stochastic taxonomic and functional recruitment. We found three-phased recruitment trajectories shaped by a gradual balance between stochastic and deterministic recruitment. Trajectories first relied on the stochastic recruitment of pre-disturbance grown saplings, before the dominance of deterministic recruitment of trees from the seed bank undergoing competitive exclusion for light. Trajectories eventually restored the stochastic recruitment specific to old-growth forests along with communities initial states. Communities resilience was consistent but while it proved fast in a common functional space among communities the taxonomic resilience was decades-long and maintained initial composition differences. The response of tropical forests to disturbance shaped by deterministic, competitive recruitment ensures taxonomic and functional resilience. Forests response quickly recovered common functioning but composition differences, also restored, drove decades-long recovery diverging among communities. Although promising for the maintenance of forests’ multiple biodiversity facets under a changing context, these results called cautions regarding the duration of management practices and the consistency of similar trajectories after repeted disturbance.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Determining the response of tropical forests to disturbance is key to predict their fate in the global changing context. In the last decades, tropical forests experienced a wide range of disturbance, from radical land-use changes for agriculture or mining <span class="citation">(Dezecache et al. 2017; Dezécache et al. 2017)</span> to more insidious changes of communities structure, diversity and functioning following climatic changes <span class="citation">(M. Aubry-Kientz et al. 2015)</span> or anthropogenic activities like selective logging <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012; Hérault and Gourlet-Fleury 2016)</span>. In that respect a vast literature successfully modeled communities response to disturbance in terms of tree growth <span class="citation">(Gourlet-Fleury and Houllier 2000)</span>, tree height <span class="citation">(Rutishauser et al. 2016)</span>, carbon stocks and water and nutrient fluxes <span class="citation">(F. E. Putz et al. 2012; Martin et al. 2015; Piponiot et al. 2016)</span>. However, similar approaches regarding forest diversity remain hindered by the huge biological diversity constraining studies to focus on common or commercial species, and by the scarcity of long-term monitoring <span class="citation">(Sebbenn et al. 2008; Rozendaal, Soliz-Gamboa, and Zuidema 2010; Vinson et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>Major insights on forests diversity response to disturbance would be given by communities trajectories along time. Communities comprise on the one hand the trees surviving from before disturbance and on the other hand those recruited afterward <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>. Surviving trees already proved mirroring the diversity of pre-disturbance communities, so communities trajectories and resilience would depend on the diversity of recruited trees that build the future community. First, recruitment trajectories depend on the composition and diversity of the initial, pre-disturbance community that conditions the pool of recruitable species via the existing saplings and seed bank <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>. Then, trajectories depend either on stochastic recruitment determined by recruitment and dispersal limitations <span class="citation">(Hurtt and Pacala 1995; Stephen P. Hubbell 2001)</span>, or deterministic processes like niche-based competition or biotic interaction <span class="citation">(Adler, HilleRislambers, and Levine 2007)</span>. Stochastic processes build communities as random samples of the larger regional-scale forest. Deterministic processes in turn rely at this spatial scale on the interactions among species and with abiotic environment that filter-out recruited species following their ecology. Understand the mechanisms of communities trajectories primarily requires to estimate the importance of the initial community composition and then balance between stochastic and deterministic processes. These mechanisms would then shed light on communities resilience and on the time to recover pre-disturbance ecosystem properties, eventually to adjust exploitation and conservation guidelines <span class="citation">(S Díaz et al. 2005; Gardner et al. 2007; Schwartz, Falkowski, and Peña-Claros 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>The ecological processes shaping the trajectories differently affect communities taxonomic characteristics, that consider all species equal, and functional characteristics, which accounts for species ecology and functioning <span class="citation">(Violle et al. 2007; Kunstler et al. 2016)</span>. Two communities may indeed be very different in terms of species diversity but very similar in terms of morphological traits and functioning <span class="citation">(Villéger et al. 2012)</span>. The differences between taxonomic and functional trajectories are insightful of recruitment rules, specifically regarding the deterministic processes and their strengh <span class="citation">(Mayfield and Levine 2010; Fukami et al. 2005)</span>. At this local spatial scale, deterministic processes rely on competitive interactions among trees determined by their functional differences in the use of limited shared resources <span class="citation">(Webb et al. 2002; Perronne et al. 2017)</span>. Determinisitic processes ruling the assemblages of species are a balance between the differences in species competitive ability and ecological niche. Differences in competitive ability will drive the most competitive species to dominance and the least competitive to elimination, thus decreasing the functional diversity. Niche differences in turn favor low densities and low similarity among species, thus increasing the functional diversity <span class="citation">(Ackerly 2003; McGill et al. 2006; Kunstler et al. 2012)</span>. In tropical forests where the light is limiting, communities response to disturbance proved a shift from slow-growing, long-lived species with “conservative” resource use to fast growing, resource “acquisitive” species <span class="citation">(Denslow 1980; J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001; Bongers et al. 2009)</span>.<br />
The competition processes at stake would therefore be grasp by key leaf, wood and life-history functional traits assessing species ecology and resources acquisition strategy <span class="citation">(I. J. Wright et al. 2004; J. Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011; Gerhold et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>Beyond the mere understanding of response mechanisms, disentangle deterministic from stochastic processes insights the underlyings of communities resilience. Controversies remained about resilience determinism, entailing the convergence of communities towards a given structure likely defined by the environment <span class="citation">(Clements 1916)</span>, opposed to a stochastic point of view entailing commnuities divergence through species random recruitment <span class="citation">(Diamond 1975)</span>. Recently both points of view were reconciled under the hypothesis the communities diverge in the taxonomic space while they converge in the functional space with determined diversity and composition in functional niches. This hypothesis however remains to be tested for in tropical forest, despite their importance in guiding ecosystems management and conservation policies.</p>
<p>In this paper we followed the fate of recruited tree communities (60121 individuals) over 30 years on a large disturbance gradient, with 1 to 60% of forest biomass removed. We assessed the taxonomic and functional diversity of recruited trees and associated traits trajectories, using a large functional trait database covering the leaf, wood and life-history spectra. We besides followed the dissimilarity in composition of recruited trees compared to the initial communities. Eventually we compared the observed trajectories to a stochastic recruitment entailing the recruits random sampling and the randomization of their functional traits. These trajectories aimed to asses the recruitment mechanisms underlying forests response to disturbance, specifically assessing (i) the role of deterministic compared to stochastic processes and (ii) the competition deterministic processes invovled. Recruitment trajectories eventually (iii) enlightened the taxonomic and functional facets of forests resilience and its consequences on forests future.</p>
