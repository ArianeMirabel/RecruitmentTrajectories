<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Discussion</h1>
<p>From the 30 years of forest dynamics survey in the Paracou station we highlighted contrasting recruitment mechanisms between control and post-disturbance tropical forests. The difference among treatments were also significant which suggest an intensity threshold between the first and second disturbance treatment and could involve gaps size, the richness of exploited trees or the intervention density <span class="citation">(Denslow 1980)</span>. &gt; If we go for a model, maybe we can test the most relevant parameter!?</p>
<p>Disturbance increases the recruitment rate which subsequently increased the richness of recruitment but impaired its evenness, all the more so that disturbance intensity was high. After disturbance the recruitment was then dominated by a restricted pool of species and Shannon and Simpson diversities decreased up to lower values than those of control plots.</p>
<p>For the 15 first years following disturbance the recruitement seemed driven by the growth of pre-disturbance saplings on hold of suitable growth condition that benefitted from the environmental changes. This translated by an increase in the functional diversity of recruits for all disturbance intensity and an even distribution of functional traits. According to the high increase of SLA CWM trajectory <a href="results.html#fig:Fig5">3.5</a> right after disturbance these early recruited species would been pionneers dominating the recruited community until 10 years after disturbance.</p>
<p>After this first recruitment phase, in the case of low disturbance intensity (T1 plots) the recruitment was highly nested within the community in place and displayed a richness and evenness similar to those of a random sampling null-model. This argues for the existence of some recruitment limitation meaning the strive of a variety of species, even when not the most fitted for the environmental context, because the best competitors couldn’t set in the disturbed area. The key role of recruitment limitation in recovery dynamic was already highlighted for low disturbance intensity in tropical wet forests <span class="citation">(Hubbell et al. 1999; Sheil and Burslem 2003; Bongers et al. 2009)</span> and supported the IDH as it mitigates competitive exclusion and maintains some inferior competitiors in the community. Recruitment and dispersal limitation are consistent with the short dispersal distance observed for tropical trees, and it was already highlighted in Paracou through the genetic clumping observed for some pioneers <span class="citation">(Leclerc et al. 2015; Scotti et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>In the case of high disturbance intensity, the species turnover was high and the functional diversity decreased rapidly, along a recruitment shift towards acquisitive functional strategies. This was particularly marked for functional traits of the leaf and stem and for life history traits (Leaf thickness, SLA, Wood Specific Gravity and Hmax) which values represented a community of fast-growing species with a high resources acquisition strategies <span class="citation">(I. J. Wright et al. 2004; J. Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011; Reich 2014)</span>. The time elpased between disturbance and the significance of those functional and diversity shifts suggests that the second recruitment phase stems from the germination at the moment of the disturbance of seeds of the seed bank. This recruitment would undergo a range of environmental filters and thus restricting the pool of species recruited <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span>.</p>
<p>Eventually, we observed that disturbance induced particular recruitment mechanisms but also set aside mechanisms at stake in natural plots. Diversity of recruited community in undisturbed plots was higher than this observed for a random-sampling null model, suggesting mechanisms maintaining high diversity like negative density dependance <span class="citation">(K. E. Harms et al. 2000)</span>.</p>
<p>Previous studies already highlighted the significant diversity increase of communities as a whole (Mirabel et al., in.prep.) that seemed supported here by a shift in recruitment dynamics in favor of acquisitive functional types <span class="citation">(TerSteege and Hammond 2001)</span>.</p>
<p>After 30 years stands functional characteristics had recovered whenever the disturbance intensity but significant taxonomic diversity difference persisted when the disturbance intensity was high. Stands functioning would then recover faster than taxonomic composition, which questions the recovery and the role of functional redundancy regarding tropical forests diversity. In any case, the recruitment turnover compared to initial stand ended up close to zero. This argued for the maintenance or for the recovery in relation to the stand <span class="citation">(Anderson 2007)</span> of the before-disturbance environment. It also supported the convergence of communities tree species taxonomic and functional composition in the long term <span class="citation">(Li et al. 2016)</span>. The communities recruited after disturbance would then persist for more than 30 years as suggested by the remaining difference among treatments but the initial recruitment dynamics seemed restored at this point, ensuring communities resilience if no other disturbance is applied. The different results of two studies on the same site 10 years <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span> and 20 years <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span> already suggested the recovery towards initial taxonomic and functional condition of the stands in revealing a decreasing proportion of pioneers between the two periods. This is however only valid for a single disturbance event, given that second recruitment phase assumed to rely on the seed bank triggers a storage effect likely modifying the trajectories after another disturbance event. We assume that in this case the competitive exclusion among dormant life-stage (seeds or even seedlings) would be harsher and bring more radical changes in the recuitment composition and functional profile. Some functional shift towards more acquisitive, small seeded and globally disturbance resitant species building a more resilient community as it has been observed by <span class="citation">(Haddad et al. 2008)</span> who linked the persistence of species to their ability to recover from disturbance which is the seed mass , growth rate linked to WD and SLA for plants. Additionally to a somehow depleted seed bank this strongly questioned the repeatability of observed trajectories after other disturbance events.</p>
<p>Our long-term study of diversity trajectories after disturbance desentangled the mechanisms underlying stands diversity. While, in undisturbed forests, mechanisms like negative density dependence enhanced species diversity, any disturbance induced new mechanisms depending on the disturbance intensity. In any case, communities short term response first reflected the growth of a variety of already grown saplings which increased the taxonomic and functional evenness of the community. When the disturbance was low, recruitment limitation was balanced against environmental filters and induced a recruited community mirroring the stand in place while selecting more acquisitive functional types. When the disturbance was intense however the species turnover was high and induced a recruited community significantly dominated by acquisitive functional types and a restricted pool of species. In both cases plots recruitment is specific, because it is determined by the surrounding stand in case of low disturbance or because the competitive exclusion randomly selected a restricted pool of species after intense disturbance. At the landscape scale, then, disturbance increased the diversity through the “between patch” difference <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Denslow1987"><strong>???</strong></span>; Chesson 2000; Sheil and Burslem 2003)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Connell 1978, refute the “equal chance HP because trees don’t recruit equally” Contrary to Hubbell and Molino: the question is “do gaps allow specific species to establish which would thrive otherwise?” <span class="citation">(Sheil and Burslem 2003)</span>. The turnover answers that yes it does <!-- Baraloto, 2012: on juveniles the differences were still at stake. --></p>
