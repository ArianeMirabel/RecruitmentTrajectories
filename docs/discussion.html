<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Discussion</h1>
<p>Our analysis of the taxonomic and functional response of tree recruitment over 30 years following a disturbance gradient highlighted a three-phased successional pathway shaped by an interplay between stochastic recruitment and deterministic processes. Although the recruitment trajectories suggested community taxonomic and functional recovery, this remained unachieved after 30 years.</p>
<div id="a-three-phased-deterministic-successional-pathway" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> A three-phased deterministic successional pathway</h2>
<p>Post-disturbance recruitment trajectories followed a three-phased successional pathway defined by the emergence of deterministic competition processes for light. Following disturbance these processes balanced stochastic ones, corresponding to species a random recruitment of species regardless of their functional characteristics as it was observed in undisturbed communities.</p>
<p>A first phase (0-8 years), defined by a very low taxonomic turnover between recruited trees and initial communities, corresponded to the lag before the disturbance impact translated into changes in the recruited communities (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:Turnover">3.3</a>). Recruitment taxonomic and functional trajectories matched the trajectories of the null model, so species functional strategy did not influence their recruitment (Figure (<a href="results.html#fig:DivTraj">3.1</a>)). The first phase would correspond to the recruitment of pre-disturbance surviving saplings (DBH &lt; 10 cm), grown and almost settled before disturbance and corresponding to late-successional species. These species display “resource-conservative” functional strategies, <em>i.e.</em> dense leaf and wood tissues and low exchange surface, favored in undisturbed communities where light levels are low <span class="citation">(Peet 1992; Denslow and Guzman 2000)</span>. These saplings were the first to benefit from the alleviated competition and the higher light availability that is known to follow disturbance and foster plant productivity and growth <span class="citation">(Monteith 1972; Chazdon and Fetcher 1984)</span>.</p>
<p>A second phase (8-15 years) was marked by an increase of the taxonomic turnover between recruited trees and initial communities, a decrease of recruits richness and evenness compared to the null model, and a shift in recruits functional composition towards more “resource-acquisitive” strategies. This would mark the recruitment of trees germinated from seeds, that will eventually represent the main part of the recruitment <span class="citation">(Lawton and Putz 1988)</span>. The time elapsed since disturbance corresponded to the time for these pioneers to reach a 10cm DBH and to dominate the recruited community, which decreased recruits taxonomic richness and evenness and made the recruitment trajectories depart from those of the null model. Recruitment processes then changed after disturbance, with the emergence of deterministic processes favoring a restricted pool of species. During this second phase, the functional composition of the recruited community changed towards more “resource-acquisitive” functional strategies (Figure (<a href="results.html#fig:CWM">3.2</a>)), <em>i.e.</em> high SLA and low maximum height, leaf toughness and wood specific gravity <span class="citation">(Wright et al. 2004; Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011)</span>. Favored species hence displayed efficient light acquisition (high SLA and leaf chlorophyll content) and inexpensive, short-lived tissues (low leaf thickness and toughness, small Hmax and low wood specific gravity and bark thickness). This confirmed the role of light availability in the post-disturbance successional pathways, as already demonstrated in temperate and tropical forests <span class="citation">(Peña-Claros et al. 2008; Carreño-Rocabado et al. 2012; Kunstler et al. 2016; Both et al. 2019)</span>. The balance in recruited communities between pioneers and species from late-succession, pre-disturbance community determined the difference between null and observed trajectories. This difference depended on the disturbance intensity (Figure (<a href="results.html#fig:DivTraj">3.1</a>)): following low intensity disturbance (T1 plots), pioneers and late-successional species were balanced <span class="citation">(Bongers et al. 2009)</span>. Following intense disturbance (T2 and T3 plots), deterministic processes prevailed and the composition of recruited communities rapidly differed from this of the pre-disturbance community with a high dominance of fast growing pioneers like <em>Cecropia spp.</em> or <em>Vismia spp.</em>.</p>
<p>A third recruitment ongoing phase (starting around 15 years) delineated by a return towards pre-disturbance values of functional diversity and taxonomic richness but not of taxonomic evenness, while the functional composition remains altered (Figure (<a href="results.html#fig:DivTraj">3.1</a>) &amp; (<a href="results.html#fig:CWM">3.2</a>)). Although recruited species remained mainly light-demanding, so pioneer species still dominated the recruited communities, but late-successional ones progressively settled <span class="citation">(Fortunel et al. 2014)</span>. This would translate the progressive closing of forest canopy and the increase competition for light and space [<span class="citation">Peet (1992)</span>;<span class="citation">Denslow and Guzman (2000)</span>;] Deterministic recruitment processes then gradually left room again to stochastic recruitment as observed in undisturbed forest <span class="citation">(Lawton and Putz 1988; Chave 2004)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="community-recovery" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Community recovery</h2>
<p>Following disturbance, there was a recovery of community taxonomic and functional composition and of the stochastic recruitment processes observed for undisturbed communities. This confirmed previous results from the Paracou experiment, conducted 10 years <span class="citation">(Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span> and 20 years <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span> after disturbance, where the early signs of the resilience of pre-disturbance taxonomic and functional composition recovery had been detected.</p>
<p>Thirty years after disturbance, recruited community taxonomic richness and evenness returned towards pre-disturbance values and their taxonomic composition returned towards this of pre-disturbance states. This maintained community initial diversity and composition and meant a low recruitment of species absent in the pre-disturbance community, confirming the importance of dispersal limitation among tropical tree species <span class="citation">(Svenning and Wright 2005)</span>. Functional composition and diversity trajectories returned as well towards pre-disturbance values, confirming the maintenance of community functional diversity and composition <span class="citation">(Fukami et al. 2005; Fortunel et al. 2014)</span>.</p>
<p>Although community taxonomic and functional recovery was ongoing, recruits diversity and composition remained altered 30 years after disturbance. Specifically, the higher the disturbance intensity, the more presistent the dominance of light-demanding species. This long-term impact on community composition likely alters community functioning <span class="citation">(Díaz et al. 2005)</span>, which raises questions for tropical forests management. Most valuable species indeed are late-successional species and their exploitation would require cutting cycles of more than 30 years <span class="citation">(Putz et al. 2012)</span>.</p>
