<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Discussion</h1>
<p> Our analysis of the taxonomic and functional response of tree recruitment over 30 years following a disturbance gradient revealed a three-phased successional pathway shaped by an interplay between stochastic recruitment and deterministic processes. Although the recruitment trajectories suggested community taxonomic and functional recovery, the return to the initial stage remained unachieved after 30 years.</p>
<div id="a-three-phased-deterministic-successional-pathway" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> A three-phased deterministic successional pathway</h2>
<p>Post-disturbance recruitment trajectories followed a three-phased successional pathway defined by the emergence of deterministic competition processes for light, that balanced the stochastic processes involved in undisturbed communities before disturbance. Indicative species of disturbed plots corresponded to pionners and light demanding species while indicative species of undistrubed plots were shade-tolerant, late successional species.</p>
<p>A first phase (<em>i.e.</em> 0-8 years) was defined by a very low taxonomic turnover between recruited trees and initial communities (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:Turnover">3.3</a>), and by similar taxonomic and functional trajectories matching the null model trajectories (Figure (<a href="results.html#fig:DivTraj">3.1</a>)). The first phase corresponded to the time lapse before recruitment processes markedly changed. During this phase, recruits comprised a few pioneer species, like <em>Cecropia obtusa</em>, and rather corresponded to the growth of pre-disturbance surviving saplings (with DBH &lt; 10 cm), that were late-successional species like <em>Lecythis persistens</em> or <em>Licania alba</em>. These species displayed “resource-conservative” functional strategies, <em>i.e.</em> dense leaf and wood tissues and low exchange surface, favored in undisturbed communities where light levels are low <span class="citation">(Peet 1992; Denslow and Guzman 2000)</span>. These saplings were the first to benefit from the alleviated competition and the higher light availability that is known to follow disturbance and foster plant productivity and growth <span class="citation">(Monteith 1972; Chazdon and Fetcher 1984)</span>.</p>
<p>A second phase (<em>i.e.</em> 8-15 years) was marked by an increase of the taxonomic turnover between recruited trees and initial communities, and a decrease of recruits richness and evenness compared to the null model. The second phase also corresponded to a shift in recruits functional composition towards more “resource-acquisitive” strategies. Indicative species switched from pioneers of genus <em>Cecropia</em> or <em>Vismia</em>, to non-pioneer light demanding species of genuses <em>Cupania</em>, <em>Xylopia</em> or <em>Miconia</em>. The shift would mark the recruitment of trees germinated from seeds, eventually representing the main part of the recruitment <span class="citation">(Lawton and Putz 1988)</span>. This first phase was the time lapse before pioneers, like <em>Miconia tschudyoides</em>, <em>Inga spp.</em>, <em>Tapirira spp.</em>, and <em>Cecropia spp.</em>, became dominant among recruits. The dominance of pioneers decreased the taxonomic richness and evenness of recruited trees and made the recruitment trajectories depart from those of the null model. Recruitment processes then changed after disturbance, with the emergence of deterministic processes favoring a restricted pool of species. During the second phase, the recruitment functional composition switched from a random trait assembly to more “resource-acquisitive” functional strategies (Figure (<a href="results.html#fig:CWM">3.2</a>)). Species displaying high SLA and low maximum height, leaf toughness and wood specific gravity became dominant <span class="citation">(Wright et al. 2004; Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011)</span>. During the second succession phase, a net advantage then emerged for species displaying efficient light acquisition, with high SLA and leaf chlorophyll content, and displaying inexpensive, short-lived tissues, with low leaf thickness, leaf toughness, small Hmax, low wood specific gravity, and low bark thickness. The advantage gained by “light acquisitive” species confirmed the role of light availability in the post-disturbance successional pathways, as already demonstrated in temperate and tropical forests <span class="citation">(Peña-Claros et al. 2008; Carreño-Rocabado et al. 2012; Kunstler et al. 2016; Both et al. 2019)</span>. The emergence of deterministic processes favoring pioneers balanced the neutral species assemblage where late-successional species were dominant, like in undisturbed communities. Deterministic processes made post-disturbance trajectories depart from the null trajectories, all the more so that the disturbance was intense (Figure (<a href="results.html#fig:DivTraj">3.1</a>)). Following low intensity disturbance (T1 plots), pioneers and late-successional species were balanced <span class="citation">(Bongers et al. 2009)</span>. Following intense disturbance (T2 and T3 plots), deterministic processes prevailed and the composition of recruited communities rapidly differed from this of the pre-disturbance community.</p>
<p>A third recruitment ongoing phase (starting around 15 years) was delineated by a return towards pre-disturbance values of functional diversity and taxonomic richness, while taxonomic evenness and functional composition remained altered (Figure (<a href="results.html#fig:DivTraj">3.1</a>) &amp; (<a href="results.html#fig:CWM">3.2</a>)). Although recruited species were mainly light-demanding and pioneers, like species from <em>Inga</em>, <em>Miconia</em>, or <em>Licania</em> genera, late-successional species progressively settled, like <em>Licania alba</em> <span class="citation">(Fortunel et al. 2014)</span>. The recruitment of late-successionals would translate the progressive closing of forest canopy and the increase competition for light and space [<span class="citation">Peet (1992)</span>;<span class="citation">Denslow and Guzman (2000)</span>;] Deterministic recruitment processes then gradually left room again to stochastic recruitment as observed in undisturbed forest <span class="citation">(Lawton and Putz 1988; Chave 2004)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="community-recovery" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Community recovery</h2>
<p>Following disturbance, community taxonomic and functional composition recovered towards pre-disturbance values. Such recovery confirmed previous results from the Paracou experiment, conducted 10 years <span class="citation">(Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span> and 20 years <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span> after disturbance, where the early signs of the resilience of pre-disturbance taxonomic and functional composition recovery had been detected.</p>
<p>Thirty years after disturbance, the taxonomic and functional diversity and composition of the recruited community returned towards pre-disturbance states <span class="citation">(Fukami et al. 2005; Fortunel et al. 2014)</span>. The recovery of pre-disturbance states meant the maintenance of community diversity and composition, and a low recruitment of species absent in the pre-disturbance community. It then confirmed the importance of dispersal limitations among tropical tree species <span class="citation">(Svenning and Wright 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>Although community taxonomic and functional recovery was ongoing, both remained altered 30 years after disturbance. Besides, the recovery of community taxonomic richness was faster, while this of the functional richness tracked the trajectory of the taxonomic evenness <span class="citation">(Grime 1998)</span>. The higher the disturbance intensity, the more persistent the dominance of light-demanding species. Such long-term impact raises questions for tropical forests management as most valuable species are late-successional species, so their exploitation would require cutting cycles longer than 30 years <span class="citation">(Putz et al. 2012)</span>. Besides, persistent changes in community composition likely alters community functioning <span class="citation">(Díaz et al. 2005)</span>, and increases the risk of losing keystone species, with unexpected ecological consequences <span class="citation">(Jones, Lawton, and Shachak 1994; Chazdon 2003)</span>. Infrequent species might indeed have unique functional characteristics in the ecosystem, apart from the ones considered here, or be a key resource for some of the fauna <span class="citation">(Schleuning et al. 2016)</span>.</p>
