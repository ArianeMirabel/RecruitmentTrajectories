<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Discussion</h1>
<p>From the 30 years of forest dynamics survey in the Paracou station we highlighted the contrasting recruitment mechanisms between control and post-disturbance tropical forests. In disturbed stands a significant selection that was positively correlated to the disturbance intensity increased the dominance among recruited trees. The response of functional diversity to disturbance was unimodal with a peak betweeen 5 and 10 years after disturbance and, for the lower disturbance, the maintenance of a higher than control stands until 30 years after disturbance. We suggest that the first increase in functional diversity is due to recruitment of a variety of saplings from the before-disturbance stand on hold of suitable growth condition. This would be followed by the recruitment of trees from the seed bank which germinated at the moment of the disturbance and undergo significant environmental filters selecting acquisitive strategies. For low disturbance intensity this second recruitment dynamics from the soil seed bank displayed a low species-abundance turnover (<a href="results.html#fig:Fig3">3.3</a>) and fitted a random recruitment model (<a href="results.html#fig:Fig2">3.2</a>). This suggested some recruitment limitation <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Hubbell1978"><strong>???</strong></span>; <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="bongers2009"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> in the T1 plots, due to the short dispersal distance of tropical trees, that is consistent with the genetic clumping observed for some pioneer species after disturbance <span class="citation">(Leclerc et al. 2015; Scotti et al. 2015)</span> driving a rapid close of the forest <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Newbery1998"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>. For intense disturbance the turnover proved significantly higher which suggested the role of competitive exclusions restricting the pool of recruited species as suggested by the lower diversity than obtained from a random null model and previously observed <span class="citation">(Molino et Sabatier 2001)</span>. &gt; Confirms the IDH and Molino results + “between patch” model for high richness <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Chesson2000"><strong>???</strong></span>; <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Sheil2003"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span></p>
<p>Whenever the disturbance intensity the species-abondance turnover decreased up to the initial and control stands values which argues for the recovery of the before-disturbance environment, which may vary or not in a tight relation to the stand <span class="citation">(Anderson 2007)</span> and the convergence of communities composition <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="reftobeadded"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>.</p>
<p>The difference in trajectories among treatments suggest the existence of a disturbance intensity threshold that would be between the first and second disturbance intensity applied here and involve the gaps size, the richness of exploited trees or the intervention density.</p>
<p>In undisturbed plots on the contrary some mechanisms might increase the recruits richness and equitability as observed recuited community are more diverse than in the case of equal recruitment success. &gt; In any case the density-dependence mechanisms maintaining forest diversity are lost after disturbance (this is why punctual recruitment is lower).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Confirms the IDH and Molino results BUT the mechanisms maintaining a high diversity are a whole, between closed forests (see negative density dependence) and gap dynamics <span class="citation">(Denslow 1987)</span>. In natural stands, any type of dominance preventing (<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Connell1978"><strong>???</strong></span>; <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Sheil2003"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>) Connell 1978, refute the “equal chance HP because trees don’t recruit equally”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As suggested in <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="bongers2009"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> the recruited community is nested with the stand in place so as we are in wet forests, the intensity generating disturbance should be higher. Contrary to Hubbell and Molino: the question is “do gaps allow specific species to establish which would thrive otherwise?” <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Sheil2003"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>. The turnover answers that yes it does</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>The functional diversity of recruited trees also increases after disturbance, probably because of higher recruitment rates. It decreases more rapidly for the higher disturbance intensity, this reflects that some species dominate the recruitment when the intensity is high <a href="results.html#fig:Fig4">3.4</a>. &gt; Hubbel 1999 didn’t observe higher diversity in canopy gaps, recruitment limitation make stochastic events redominant: we also observe an increase of richness due to higher recruitment but more dominance in the higher disturbance intensity. All the same as Hubbell, except for T3: competitive exclusion enters so the threshold is located between the two intensities (the threshold is AGB removed or diversity after disturbance). &gt; To argues for the change in assembly processes mechanisms after disturbance, because obviously negative-density dependence <span class="citation">(Harms et al. 2000)</span> is not at stake anymore (they browsed a wide range of ecology so it is not the composition that makes the difference). &gt; Acquisitive like functional traits associated with higher diversity and disturbance dynamics <span class="citation">(TerSteege et Hammond 2001)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>30 years after disturbance it seems that the recruitment dynamics have recovered (<a href="results.html#fig:Fig4">3.4</a>,<a href="results.html#fig:Fig6">3.6</a>). But the post disturbance changes remain visible at the scale of the community (<a href="results.html#fig:Fig1">3.1</a>,<a href="results.html#fig:Fig2">3.2</a>,<a href="results.html#fig:Fig3">3.3</a>). <!-- Baraloto, 2012: on juveniles the differences were still at stake. --></p></li>
<li><p>The big question is then: would we observe the same dynamic after a second cycle or is the seed bank depleted after the recruitment of old-growth species. HP: A second rotation would be lethal for the stand composition recovery. &gt; Storage effect, avoid competitive exclusion through dormant life stage</p></li>
