<p>We analyzed the trajectories followed by the composition, diversity, and functional characteristics of trees recruited after disturbance to highlight the response of tropical forests and determine their resilience and help future conservation strategies. The 30 years-long monitoring analysed allowed to identify the different steps of forests recovery and the corresponding assembly rules. We identified two distinct phases, the first corresponding to the recruitment of pre-disturbance saplings that reflected the diversity and composition of the stand in place, and the second driven by “true recruits” germinated from the seed bank after disturbance. The second phase involved environmental selection and progressive competition among species according to the disturbance intensity, which build recruited communities divergent from the initial stand persisting in the long term.</p>
<div id="on-the-underlyings-of-the-hump-shaped-trajectories" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> On the underlyings of the hump-shaped trajectories</h2>
<p>The trajectories of punctual recruitment richness, of some key functional traits (SLA and bark thickness) and of species turn-over exhibited hump-shaped, unimodal trajectories.</p>
<p>The recruitment for 10-15 first years after disturbance did not substantially differ from this of control plots. Recruitment trajectories were driven by the growth of pre-disturbance saplings benefiting from the environmental changes and alleviated competition following disturbance <span class="citation">(Hérault et al. 2010)</span>. The functional diversity of the recruitment remained stable after low disturbance intensity, equating these of control plots and matching stochastic recruitment processes. After intense disturbance, this phase brought sharp increases in the SLA, wood density and leaf thickness trajectories. This tendencies revealed prominent recruitment, above an intensity threshold, of short-lived, fast growing <em>hard pionneers</em> species with competitive and efficient light acquisition (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:Fig4">3.4</a>) <span class="citation">(I. J. Wright et al. 2004; J. Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011; Reich 2014)</span>.</p>
<p>Following this first phase, the recruitment progressively incorporated true recruits, <em>i.e.</em> trees germinated from the seed bank, resulting in a decrease of recruited trees evenness and functional diversity. A restriction in the pool of species was then recruited, following an interplay between deterministic processes excluding less competitive and stress-tolerant species, and stochastic recruitment as in mature forests that progressively emerged again. The balance betwwen both processes was determined by the intensity of the initial disturbance. After low disturbance intensity (T1 plots), the taxonomic composition of the recruitment resembled the pre-disturbance communities but pool of recruited species was restricted by selective pressures on the strategy of resource use. Favored species were more pioneers and light demanders, with strategies of efficient resource acquisition (high SLA and leaf chlorophyll content) and inexpensive, short-lived tissues (low leaf thickness and thoughness, small Hmax and low wood density and bark thickness). Correspondingly the functional diversity increased, equating or exceeding this of control plots, which revealed an overdispersion of the functional traits that was probably driven by the limitation of functional similarity among species. Despite some competitive exclusion then, recruited species still browsed a large functional range with no high dominance of hard pionners <span class="citation">(S P Hubbell et al. 1999; Sheil and Burslem 2003; Bongers et al. 2009)</span>. This might due to recruitment and dispersal limitation due to the short dispersal distance observed for tropical trees, specifically in Paracou with the genetic clumping of some pioneers <span class="citation">(Leclerc et al. 2015; Scotti et al. 2015)</span>. After intense disturbance however, the first species recruited were hard pioneers, which taxonomic composition highly differed from the initial community and that generated a sharp increase for the SLA and bark thickness weighted values. This was observed for 15 years after disturbance, which corresponds to the life expectancy of hard pionners, before the functional diversity increased again, acquisitive functional still dominating, and the recruited trees progressively resembled the initial composition and diversity. Communities trajectories then involved the interplay between stochastic recruitment and deterministic processes and advocated the role of disturbance to maintain forests diversity, in line with the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001; Sheil and Burslem 2003)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> On the resilience of the recruitment process</h2>
<p>Both recruitment richness and functional diversity had recovered thirty years after all disturbance intensity, reaching equivalent levels as those of undisturbed forests. At that time though the recruitment remain more important in disturbed plots and did not match the richness and evenness of stochastic recruitment. However the divergence from stochasticity progressively shrinked, arguing for a consistent but long-term recovery of the recruitment process. These processes eventually made the recruitment converging towards the initial state, with the recruited species durably mirroring the pre-disturbance community. More than commonly thought, the taxonomic trajectories therefore depended on the pre-disturbance ecosystem characteristics and leads to maintain the initial differences among communities <span class="citation">(Anderson 2007; Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>. In contrast the trajectories of traits and functional diversity were essentially similar among treatments, arguing for the confluence of communities in the functional space despite their divergence in taxonomic composition <span class="citation">(Fukami et al. 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>The taxonomic and functional characteristics of tropical forests were both resilient, even if the settlment of long lived pioneers after intense disturbance make a long term process of their recovery and still impact communities functioning and diversity 30 years after disturbance. This confirms previous results from the Paracou experiment, conducted 10 years <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span> and 20 years <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span> after disturbance, which suggested the resilience of taxonomic and functional composition.</p>
<p>The time length of the recovery processes entails great caution regarding the forest conservation and exploitation guidelines which should allow a complete recovery of pre-disturbance conditions. To that was added the involvement of the seed bank in the recovery processes which own resilience remains unknown. Any storage effect, altering the pool of recruitable species, would modify the resilience of the community itself and impact the response to further disturbance events <span class="citation">(Norden et al. 2009)</span>. In such case, the competitive exclusion among dormant life-stage (seeds or even seedlings) would be harsher and likely bring more radical changes in the recruitment composition and functional profile of the community.</p>
