<blockquote>
<p>In any case the density-dependence mechanisms maintaining forest diversity are lost after disturbance (this is why punctual recruitment is lower).When the disturbance is low: recruitment limitation because the recruited community is nested within the existing one and the recruitment is close to rendom. When the disturbance is high there is some selection as found for Molino and this is clearly an acquisitive strategies selection.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Despite a higher number of recruits, the pool of recruited species is dominated by a smaller set of species than compared to natural forest (<a href="results.html#fig:Fig1">3.1</a>). &gt; Confirms the IDH and Molino results + “between patch” model for high richness <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Chesson2000"><strong>???</strong></span>; <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Sheil2003"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span></p></li>
<li><p>This is confirmed with the comparison to null model: in natural forest the recruitement equals a random sampling whereas it is less diverse after disturbance (<a href="results.html#fig:Fig2">3.2</a>,<a href="results.html#fig:Fig3">3.3</a>). &gt; Confirms the IDH and Molino results BUT the mechanisms maintaining a high diversity are a whole, between closed forests (see negative density dependence) and gap dynamics <span class="citation">(Denslow 1987)</span>. In natural stands, any type of dominance preventing (<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Connell1978"><strong>???</strong></span>; <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Sheil2003"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>) &gt; But for small disturbance, recruitment limitation as observed for T1</p></li>
<li><p>The turnover is high until 15 years after disturbance but then reveals a return to the initial state <a href="results.html#fig:Fig6">3.6</a>. The decreasing turnover fits the observed increase in whole plot diversity after disturbance, which suggests that recruitment dynamics are driven by competition while abiotic parameter like water supply and hazards remain stable or vary in a tight relation to the stand (light thourgh canopy openness or nutrient turnover) <span class="citation">(Anderson 2007)</span>. Rapid close of the forest [<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Newbery1998"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>;] &gt; Confirms the IDH and Molino results but according to the return time to initial depends on the gap size: we suggest that under a certain threshold the recruitment limitation prevails &gt; besides, we consider trees above 10cm dbh and long time. The first to grow are the one already big and waiting: low turnover in the beginning but it increases after for disturbed plots so the germination is different when the disturbance is high. &gt; As suggested in <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="bongers2009"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> the recruited community is nested with the stand in place so as we are in wet forests, the intensity generating disturbance should be higher. &gt; Contrary to Hubbell and Molino: the question is “do gaps allow specific species to establish which would thrive otherwise?” <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Sheil2003"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>. The turnover answers that yes it does</p></li>
<li><p>The functional diversity of recruited trees also increases after disturbance, probably because of higher recruitment rates. It decreases more rapidly for the higher disturbance intensity, this reflects that some species dominate the recruitment when the intensity is high <a href="results.html#fig:Fig4">3.4</a>. This is consistent with the observed clumping of some pioneere species after disturbance <span class="citation">(Leclerc et al. 2015; Scotti et al. 2015)</span>. &gt; Hubbel 1999 didn’t observe higher diversity in canopy gaps, recruitment limitation make stochastic events redominant: we also observe an increase of richness due to higher recruitment but more dominance in the higher disturbance intensity. All the same as Hubbell, except for T3: competitive exclusion enters so the threshold is located between the two intensities (the threshold is AGB removed or diversity after disturbance). &gt; To argues for the change in assembly processes mechanisms after disturbance, because obviously negative-density dependence <span class="citation">(Harms et al. 2000)</span> is not at stake anymore (they browsed a wide range of ecology so it is not the composition that makes the difference). &gt; Acquisitive like functional traits associated with higher diversity and disturbance dynamics <span class="citation">(TerSteege et Hammond 2001)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>30 years after disturbance it seems that the recruitment dynamics have recovered (<a href="results.html#fig:Fig4">3.4</a>,<a href="results.html#fig:Fig6">3.6</a>). But the post disturbance changes remain visible at the scale of the community (<a href="results.html#fig:Fig1">3.1</a>,<a href="results.html#fig:Fig2">3.2</a>,<a href="results.html#fig:Fig3">3.3</a>). <!-- Baraloto, 2012: on juveniles the differences were still at stake. --></p></li>
<li><p>The big question is then: would we observe the same dynamic after a second cycle or is the seed bank depleted after the recruitment of old-growth species. HP: A second rotation would be lethal for the stand composition recovery. &gt; Storage effect, avoid competitive exclusion through dormant life stage</p></li>
