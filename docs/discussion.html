<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> A three-phased deterministic successional pathway</h2>
<p>Post-disturbance recruitment trajectories rely on a three-phased succession pathway shaped by the emergence of deterministic competition processes for light gradually balancing the stochastic recruitment specific to undistubed communities.</p>
<p>In a first phase (0-8 years), recruitment likely pre-disturbance surviving saplings (DBH &lt; 10cm) that immediately benefited from the increased enlightment and the alleviated competition induced by disturbance <span class="citation">(Denslow and Guzman 2000; Hérault et al. 2010)</span>. The taxonomic and functional characterisitcs of recruited trees mirrored the pre-disturbance communities and the recruitment processes corresonded to a stochastic recruitment.</p>
<p>A second phase (8-15 years) was marked by a shift in community functional composition towards more “acquisitive” functional strategies and the dominance within recruited trees of a restricted set of species. Recruits then likely corresponded to true recruits, <em>i.e.</em> trees germinated from the seeds bank, that eventually are the main part of the whole post-disturbance recruitment <span class="citation">(Lawton and Putz 1988)</span>. Recruited trees were then dominated by short-lived, fast growing hard pionneer species with competitive and efficient light acquisition <span class="citation">(Wright et al. 2004; Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011; Reich 2014)</span>. As already demonstrated in temperate forests, competition processes restricted the pool of recruited species in enhancing the selection of species with efficient light acquisition strategy <span class="citation">(Chave 2004; Mayfield and Levine 2010; Kunstler et al. 2012)</span>. This emergence of deterministic processes balanced the stochastic recruitment observed in the first place, and the relative importance of both recruitment processes was determined by the disturbance intensity. After low intensity disturbance (T1 plots) recruited species still mirrored the taxonomic composition of pre-disturbance communities, but included more included long-lived pioneers and light-demanding species with strategies of efficient resource acquisition (high SLA and leaf chlorophyll content) and inexpensive, short-lived tissues (low leaf thickness and thoughness, small Hmax and low wood specific gravity and bark thickness) <span class="citation">(Hubbell et al. 1999; Schnitzer and Carson 2001; Sheil and Burslem 2003; Bongers et al. 2009)</span>. After intense disturbance in contrast (T2 and T3 plots), the composition of recruited trees rapidly differed from pre-disturbance community and with the high dominance of hard pioneers, such as Cecropia spp., likely entailing significant changes in communities functioning <span class="citation">(Díaz et al. 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>A third recruitment phase corresponded to the recovery of pre-disturbance taxonomic and functional characteristics. Although the recruited species remained mainly light-demanding their functional diversity increased and their taxonomic composition increasingly resembled pre-disturbance community. The deterministic recruitment processes then gradually left room to the recovery of the stochastic recruitment processes specific to undisturbed forest <span class="citation">(Lawton and Putz 1988; Chave 2004; Mayfield and Levine 2010)</span>.</p>

<div id="the-achievement-of-communities-recovery" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> The achievement of communities recovery</h2>
<p>After disturbance the stochastic recruitment processes of undisturbed communities progressively recovered, drivingy the recovery of community taxonomic and functional convergence.</p>
<p>Recruited trees taxonomic richness and evenness recovered pre-disturbance values and their taxonomic composition converged towards the pre-disturbance community, thus maintaining the initial taxonomic differences among communities. Even after intense disturbance entailing significant changes in the forest structure and the recruitment of hard pioneers community taxonomy was resilient. The high resilience of communities taxonomy revealed that species not belonging to the pre-disturbance community were hardly recruited because of the commonness of dispersal limitation among tropical tree species (Svenning, Wright JECOL 2005).</p>
<p>The recovery of recruited trees functional diversity and composition and the similarity of the recruitment trajectories in the functional space suggested a common and resilient functioning despite taxonomic differences among communities <span class="citation">(Fukami et al. 2005)</span>. This confirmed previous results from the Paracou experiment, conducted 10 years <span class="citation">(Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span> and 20 years <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span> after disturbance, where the early signs of the resilience of taxonomic and functional composition had been detected.</p>
<p>Although resilient, the functional and taxonomic composition of recruited trees remained altered after 30 years by the dominance of more light-demanding species than in undisturbed forests. This long-term impact specifically raises questions in the context of forest exploitation, where most valuable species are late-successional species, and thus require cutting cycles of more than 30 years <span class="citation">(“Sustaining conservation values in selectively logged tropical forests: the attained and the attainable” 2012)</span>.</p>
