<p>We analyzed the trajectories followed by the composition, diversity, and functional characteristics of trees recruited after disturbance to highlight the response of tropical forests and determine their resilience and help future conservation strategies. The 30 years-long monitoring analysed allowed to identify the different steps of forests recovery and the corresponding assembly rules. We identified two distinct phases, the first corresponding to the recruitment of pre-disturbance saplings that reflected the diversity and composition of the stand in place, and the second driven by “true recruits” germinated from the seed bank after disturbance. The second phase involved environmental selection and progressive competition among species according to the disturbance intensity, which build recruited communities divergent from the initial stand persisting in the long term.</p>
<div id="on-the-underlyings-of-the-hump-shaped-trajectories" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> On the underlyings of the hump-shaped trajectories</h2>
<p>The trajectories of punctual recruitment richness, some key functional traits (SLA and bark thickness) and the species turn-over exhibited hump-shaped, unimodal trajectories.</p>
<p>The 10-15 first years of these trajectories were driven by the growth of pre-disturbance saplings benefiting from the environmental changes and alleviated competition following disturbance <span class="citation">(Hérault et al. 2010)</span>. After low disturbance intensity this translated into a stable functional diversity of the recruited community, equivalent to these of control plots shaped by stochastic recruitment processes. After intense disturbance, this phase brought sharp increases in theSLA, wood density and leaf thickness trajectories. This tendencies revealed prominent recruitment, above an intensity threshold, of short-lived, fast growing <em>hard pionneers</em> species with competitive and efficient light acquisition (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:Fig4">3.4</a>) <span class="citation">(I. J. Wright et al. 2004; J. Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011; Reich 2014)</span>.</p>
<p>Following this first phase, the recruitment progressively incorporated true recruits, <em>i.e.</em> trees germinated from the seed bank after disturbance. The resulting trajectories were shaped by the interplay between deterministic processes, excluding stress-intolerant and uncompetitive species, and mature forests-like stochastic recruitment that progressively emerged again. The balance between both processes resulted in different trajectories according to the disturbance intensity.</p>
<p>After low disturbance intensity (T1 plots), although the taxonomic composition of the recruitment resembled the pre-disturbance composition the pool of recruited species was more restricted and evenly distributed. These restrictions revealed selective pressures favouring pioneers and light demanding species with efficient resource acquisition (high SLA and leaf chlorophyll content) and inexpensive, short-lived tissues (low leaf thickness and thoughness, small Hmax and low wood density and bark thickness). In parallel the recruitment’s functional diversity increased, equating or exceeding this of control plots, revealing an overdispersion of functional traits driven by the limitation of similarity. At this disturbance intensity, recruitment seemed preserved from the competitive exclusion of hard pioneers which would have prevented the maintenance of inferior competitors in the community and have lowered the functional diversity <span class="citation">(Hubbell et al. 1999; Sheil and Burslem 2003; Bongers et al. 2009)</span>. The low dominance of hard pioneers might result from recruitment and dispersal limitation due to the short dispersal distance observed for tropical trees, specifically in Paracou with the genetic clumping of some pioneers <span class="citation">(Leclerc et al. 2015; Scotti et al. 2015)</span>. The consistent interplay between stochastic recruitment and deterministic processes advocated the role of low intensity disturbance to maintain forests diversity, in line with the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001; Sheil and Burslem 2003)</span>.</p>
<p>The trajectories after intense disturbance was first driven by the settlement of hard pioneers and then progressively by the same balance between deterministic and stochastic processes observed after low disturbance intensity. This translated by a progressive decrease of recruitment taxonomic turnover and an increase of functional diversity. Although acquisitive strategies remained dominant (high leaf chlorophyll content and low wood density and leaf toughness), the weighted values of other traits stabilized and the SLA and bark thickness decreased again (then following a unimodal trajectory with a peak after the first recruitement phase). The 15 years laps of the unimodal turnover and traits trajectories corresponding to the first recruitment phase matched the life expectancy of hard pionners and of their competitive pressure. The recruitment would progressively shift towards long-lived pionneers, that participate to forest recovery as they might have been part of pre-disturbance communities, but still hold dominant more acquisitive functional strategies.</p>

<div id="on-the-resilience-of-the-recruitment-process" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> On the resilience of the recruitment process</h2>
<p>The richness and functional diversity of recruitment had recovered for all plots thirty years after disturbance, reaching equivalent levels as those of undisturbed forests observed short after disturbance and in control plots. In contrast the evenness and functional diversity of the recruitment remained lower than in undisturbed forests, reflecting a pool of recruited species restricted but more homogeneous.</p>
<p>If the communities of recruited trees remained different than in undisturbed forests 30 years after disturbance, the recruitment processes were recovering whenever the intensity of disturbance. The divergence from null model progressively shrinked and recruitement processes therefore edged towards the stochastic recruitment of mature forests. In turn the recruited species increasingly mirrored the initial pre-disturbance communities, resulting in negligible specific turnover with mature forests. Consistently restoring the initial communities composition, the taxonomic trajectories would depend more than commonly thought on the pre-disturbance ecosystem characteristics and maintain the initial differences among communities <span class="citation">(Anderson 2007; Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>. In contrast the functional diveristy and traits trajectories essentially followed a common trajectory among treatments, supporting communities convergence in the functional space despite their divergence in taxonomic composition <span class="citation">(Fukami et al. 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>Following this, commmunities were then both functionally and taxonomically resilient despite the settlment of long lived pioneers. The latter, though, make a long term process of composition and diversity recovery after high disturbance intensity. This was evidenced here by the persistent impact on traits and diversity trajectories 30 years after disturbance and confirm previous results from the Paracou experiment, conducted 10 years <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span> and 20 years <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span> after disturbance, which suggested the resilience of taxonomic and functional composition.</p>
<p>The time length of the recovery processes entails great caution regarding the forest conservation and exploitation guidelines which should allow a complete recovery of pre-disturbance conditions. To that was added the involvement of the seed bank in the recovery processes which own resilience remains unknown. Any storage effect, altering the pool of recruitable species, would modify the resilience of the community itself and impact the response to further disturbance events <span class="citation">(Norden et al. 2009)</span>. In such case, the competitive exclusion among dormant life-stage (seeds or even seedlings) would be harsher and likely bring more radical changes in the recruitment composition and functional profile of the community.</p>
