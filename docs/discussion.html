<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> A three-phased succession shaped by deterministic processes</h2>
<p>Recruitment trajectories followed a three-phased succession pattern shaped the emergence of deterministic competition processes for light that balanced the steady-state stochastic processes of undistubed communities.</p>
<p>In a first phase (0-8 years), recruited trees mirrored the pre-disturbance communities in terms of taxonomic and functional characteristics and the recruitment trajectories resembled those of a stochastic recruitment. This first recruitment phase, likely involved already grown saplings (DBH &lt; 10cm) immediately benefitting from the increased enlightment and the alleviated competition induced by disturbance <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Denslow2000"><strong>???</strong></span>; Hérault et al. 2010)</span>.</p>
<p>A second phase (8-15 years) corresponded to a functional shift, marked by changes of trajectory for several functional traits, and to a decrease in recruitment evenness and functional diversity. At that time recruits likely corresponded to true recruits, <em>i.e.</em> trees germinated from the seeds bank, that are the main part of the whole post-disturbance recruitment <span class="citation">(Lawton and Putz 1988)</span>. The recruitment was then dominated by short-lived, fast growing hard pionneer species with competitive and efficient light acquisition <span class="citation">(Wright et al. 2004; Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011; Reich 2014)</span>. Hence, exclusive competition processes based on species light acquisition strategy restricted the pool of recruited species, as already demonstrated in temperate forests <span class="citation">(Chave 2004; Mayfield and Levine 2010; Kunstler et al. 2012)</span>. The emergence of deterministic processes then offset the stochastic recruitment observed in the first place, and the balance was determined by the initial disturbance intensity. After light disturbance (T1 plots), recruited species included more pioneers and light demanders, with strategies of efficient resource acquisition (high SLA and leaf chlorophyll content) and inexpensive, short-lived tissues (low leaf thickness and thoughness, small Hmax and low wood density and bark thickness) <span class="citation">(Hubbell et al. 1999; Schnitzer and Carson 2001; Sheil and Burslem 2003; Bongers et al. 2009)</span>. At these low disturbance intensity the pool of recruited species was restricted to more light-demanding species but still mirrored the pre-disturbance communities. The recruitment was not overwhelmed by hard pioneers, probably because of the dispersal limitations due to the short dispersal distances observed for tropical trees <span class="citation">(Leclerc et al. 2015; Scotti et al. 2015)</span>. After intense disturbance in contrast (T2 and T3 plots), the recruitment rapidly differed from the pre-disturbance composition and corresponded to a sharp increase of the SLA and bark thickness. These drastic changes of trajectory reflected an overwhelming recruitment of hard pioneers, such as Cecropia spp. likely entailing significant changes in communities functioning <span class="citation">(Díaz et al. 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>A third recruitment phase entailed a return towards initial taxonomic and functional diversities: although the recruited species remained mainly light-demanding and submitted to competitive exclusion, they displayed increasing functional diversity and similarity with pre-disturbance communities. Initial stochastic recruitment eventually recovered, restoring the steady-state equilibrium between neutral and deterministic processes <span class="citation">(Lawton and Putz 1988; Chave 2004; Mayfield and Levine 2010)</span>.</p>

<div id="the-achievement-of-communities-recovery" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> The achievement of communities recovery</h2>
<p>After disturbance the stochastic recruitment of undisturbed communities progressively recovered, shaping taxonomic and functional trajectories that converged towards the characteristic of pre-disturbance communities.</p>
<p>The taxonomic diversity and composition of recruited trees recovered after disturbance, meaning the long-term maintenance of intial taxonomic differences highlighted among the studied communities. &gt;&gt; Here I should argue that initial there were actual differences among communities, otherwise it doesn’t make sense-&gt; cite the other article?</p>
<p>Initial commmunities restored after disturbance would correspond to multiple stable equilibria, that are assumed to shape the highly diverse and productive ecosystems <span class="citation">(Chase 2003)</span>. The taxonomic trajectory after disturbance were determined by the composition of the initial communities which defined the pool grown saplings and the local seeds bank and directed the trajectories towards its recovery <span class="citation">(Dalling and Hubbell 2002; Anderson 2007)</span>.</p>
<p>The functional diversity and some traits trajectories were similar among treatments and recovered quickly, translating the convergence of communities in the functional space and the recovery of similar functioning despite their taxonomic differences <span class="citation">(Fukami et al. 2005)</span>. This confirmed previous results from the Paracou experiment, conducted 10 years <span class="citation">(Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span> and 20 years <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span> after disturbance, where the early signs of the resilience of taxonomic and functional composition had been detected.</p>
<p>Communities recovery was consistent but lasted for decades, specifically communities taxonomic diversity and composition and the average value of several functional traits remained altered for more than 30 years.</p>
