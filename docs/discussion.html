<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> On the underlyings of the hump-shaped trajectories</h2>
<p>The trajectories of recruitment richness, key functional traits (SLA and bark thickness) and the species turnover exhibited clear hump-shaped, unimodal trajectories. Within communities disturbed and undisturbed areas followed simultaneous trajectory, supporting an impact of disturbance at the whole plot scale.</p>
<p>Trees recruited in the first place (0-8 years) resembled the pre-disturbance communities and their functional diversity matched this of a stochastic recruitment process. This first recruitment phase likely involved already grown saplings (DBH &lt;10cm) that germinated before disturbance and immediatly benefitted from the increased enlightment and the alleviated competition following diturbance <span class="citation">(Hérault et al. 2010)</span>.</p>
<p>Then during a second phase the evenness and the functional diversity of recruited trees decreased, translating a more restricted pool of recruited species based on their functional strategy. Following intense disturbance, sharp changes in the SLA, wood density and leaf thickness trajectories then revealed the prominent recruitment of short-lived, fast growing hard pionneers species with competitive and efficient light acquisition (Figure <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="ref"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>(fig:Turnover)) <span class="citation">(I. J. Wright et al. 2004; J. Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011; Reich 2014)</span>.<br />
The second phase therefore likely incorporated true recruits, <em>i.e.</em> trees germinated from the seed bank, submitted to deterministic recruitment processes excluding the least competitive species. Along time diversity trajectories returned towards the initial state and matched the values of stochastic recruitment, reflecting a decreasing importance of the deterministic recruitment processes. The balance between deterministic and stochastic processes was determined by the initial disturbance intensity. After light disturbance (T1 plots), the recruitment matched the composition of the initial communities but the pool of recruited species was restricted by the competitive exclusion for resources. dominant species were more pioneers and light demanders, with strategies of efficient resource acquisition (high SLA and leaf chlorophyll content) and inexpensive, short-lived tissues (low leaf thickness and thoughness, small Hmax and low wood density and bark thickness). Although competitive exclusion decreased the functional diversity of recruited trees, their eveness remained high, so the were no high dominance of hard pionners <span class="citation">(S P Hubbell et al. 1999; Sheil and Burslem 2003; Bongers et al. 2009)</span>. This might due to recruitment and dispersal limitation due to the short dispersal distance observed for tropical trees, specifically in Paracou with the genetic clumping of some pioneers <span class="citation">(Leclerc et al. 2015; Scotti et al. 2015)</span>. After intense disturbance however, the recruitment composition rapidly differed from the pre-disturbance state and corresponded to a sharp increase of the SLA and bark thickness CWM, likely reflecting the overhelming recruitment of hard pioneers. This recruitment phase lasted for 15 years after disturbance, which corresponds to the life expectancy of hard pionners, and was followed by a progressive increase of the functional diversity. The recruitment remained dominated by acquisitive functional strategies but the initial composition and diversity progressively recovered. Communities trajectories involved an interplay between stochastic and deterministic recruitment, advocating that disturbance effectively maintained forests diversity <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001; Sheil and Burslem 2003)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> On the resilience of the recruitment process</h2>
<p>After 30 years, although taxonomic and functional diversity had recovered initial values, the recruitment remained more restricted than with the stochastic recruitment of undisturbed plots. Despite the settlement after intense disturbance of long-lived pioneers, recruitment processes proved resilient but slow to recover.</p>
<p>The recovery of recruitment processes meant the convergence of communities towards the initial state. More than commonly thought, the taxonomic trajectory of ecosystems would then rely on their pre-disturbance characteristics and concur to maintain the initial taxonomic differences among local communities <span class="citation">(Anderson 2007)</span>. In contrast the trajectories of traits and functional diversity were essentially similar among treatments, arguing for the confluence of communities in the functional space despite their divergence in taxonomic composition <span class="citation">(Fukami et al. 2005)</span>. This confirmed previous results from the Paracou experiment, conducted 10 years <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span> and 20 years <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span> after disturbance, where the early signs of the resilience of taxonomic and functional composition had been detected. Still, the functional diversity and several traits CWM values remained altered 30 years after disturbance, suggesting the long-term impact of disturbance. Both taxonomic and functional recovery therefore spread over long periods, i.e. several decades, and to involve the germination of trees from the seed bank and therefore affect the stock of recruitable species and communities response and resilience to additional disturbance <span class="citation">(Norden et al. 2009)</span>.</p>
