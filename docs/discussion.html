<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> On the underlyings of the hump-shaped trajectories</h2>
<p>Along the 30 years, the recruitment richness and species turnover compared to the initial composition, and the trajectories of key functional traits (SLA and bark thickness) exhibited clear hump-shaped trajectories, revealing three distinct recruitment phases. Communities trajectories involved an interplay between stochastic and deterministic recruitment, advocating that disturbance effectively maintained forests diversity <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001; Sheil and Burslem 2003)</span>.</p>
<p>As a first step (0-8 years), recruited trees showed low turnover compared to the initial composition and matched the functoinal diversity of a stochastic recruitment process. This first recruitment phase mirroring the old-growth pre-disturbance community then likely involved already grown saplings (DBH &lt;10cm) immediatly benefitting from the increased enlightment and the alleviated competition induced by disturbance <span class="citation">(Hérault et al. 2010)</span>.</p>
<p>A second phase then fall into place, corresponding to marked changes in several functional traits trajectories and to a decrease in the evenness and functional diversity of the recruited species. These changes revealed during the second phase a restriction in the pool of recruited species, likely selected based on their functional strategy. Indeed after intense disturbance, sharp changes in the SLA, wood density and leaf thickness trajectories revealed the prominent recruitment of short-lived, fast growing hard pionneers species with competitive and efficient light acquisition (Figure <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="ref"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>(fig:Turnover)) <span class="citation">(I. J. Wright et al. 2004; J. Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011; Reich 2014)</span>.<br />
The second phase likely incorporated true recruits, <em>i.e.</em> trees germinated from the seed bank, selected according to their resource acquisition strategy. The stochastic recruitment observed in the first place were therefore balanced with deterministic, niche-based competition processes. Along time diversity trajectories returned towards the initial state and the values of stochastic recruitment, revealing a reversed balance where stochastic recruitment progressively prevailing again. The balance along time between deterministic and stochastic processes was determined by the initial disturbance intensity. After light disturbance (T1 plots), although the pool of recruited species was restricted by the competitive exclusion for resources the turnover compared to initial state remained low. Recruited trees then still mirrored the pre-disturbance communities but recruited species were more pioneers and light demanders, with strategies of efficient resource acquisition (high SLA and leaf chlorophyll content) and inexpensive, short-lived tissues (low leaf thickness and thoughness, small Hmax and low wood density and bark thickness) <span class="citation">(S P Hubbell et al. 1999; Sheil and Burslem 2003; Bongers et al. 2009)</span>. At this disturbance intensity the recruitment evenness and functional diversity remained high so despite the selection of more light-demanding species the recruitment was not overwhelmed by hard pioneers. This might be explained by the recruitment and dispersal limitations due to the short dispersal distance observed for tropical trees, specifically in Paracou with the genetic clumping of some pioneers <span class="citation">(Leclerc et al. 2015; Scotti et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>After intense disturbance in contrast (T2 and T3 plots), the recruitment rapidly differed from the pre-disturbance composition and corresponded to a sharp increase of the SLA and bark thickness reflecting an overhelming recruitment of hard pioneers. In this case the second recruitment phase largely dominated by hard pioneers lasted for 15 years, before the pool of recruited species enlarged again. The first decrease in the recruitment functional diversity was followed by a progressive recovery revealing a third phase of more diversified recruitment. The third recruitment phase remained dominated by light-demanding species, which revealed the selection of species through deterministic competition processes, but increasingly mirrored the pre-disturbance community, suggesting a progressive recovery of stochastic recruitment processes.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> On the resilience of the recruitment process</h2>
<p>After 30 years, although taxonomic and functional diversity had recovered initial values, the recruitment remained more restricted than with the stochastic recruitment of undisturbed plots. Despite the settlement after intense disturbance of long-lived pioneers, recruitment processes proved resilient but slow to recover.</p>
<p>The recovery of recruitment processes meant the convergence of communities towards the initial state. More than commonly thought, the taxonomic trajectory of ecosystems would then rely on their pre-disturbance characteristics and concur to maintain the initial taxonomic differences among local communities <span class="citation">(Anderson 2007)</span>. In contrast the trajectories of traits and functional diversity were essentially similar among treatments, arguing for the confluence of communities in the functional space despite their divergence in taxonomic composition <span class="citation">(Fukami et al. 2005)</span>. This confirmed previous results from the Paracou experiment, conducted 10 years <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span> and 20 years <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span> after disturbance, where the early signs of the resilience of taxonomic and functional composition had been detected. Still, the functional diversity and several traits CWM values remained altered 30 years after disturbance, suggesting the long-term impact of disturbance. Both taxonomic and functional recovery therefore spread over long periods, i.e. several decades, and to involve the germination of trees from the seed bank and therefore affect the stock of recruitable species and communities response and resilience to additional disturbance <span class="citation">(Norden et al. 2009)</span>.</p>
