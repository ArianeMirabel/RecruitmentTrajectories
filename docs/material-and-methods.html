<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Study Site</h2>
<p>The Paracou station is located in a lowland tropical rain forest in French Guiana (5°18’N and 52°53’W). Climate is tropical wet with mean annual precipitation averaging 2980 mm.y<sup>-1</sup> (30-y period) and a 3-months dry season (&lt; 100 mm.months<sup>-1</sup>) from mid-August to mid-November, and a one-month dry season in March <span class="citation">(Wagner et al. 2011)</span>. Elevation ranges from 5 to 50 m and mean annual temperature is 26°C. Soils are thin acrisols over a layer of transformed saprolite with low permeability generating lateral drainage during heavy rains. The disturbance experiment spread over a network of twelve 6.25ha plots (Table <a href="#tab:Tab1"><strong>??</strong></a>) that underwent three disturbance treatments in 1986-1987 <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>. Dominant families are Fabaceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Lecythidaceae and Sapotaceae.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Inventories Protocol and Dataset Collection</h2>
<p>All trees above 10 cm DBH were mapped and measured annually since 1984. During inventories, trees were first identified with a vernacular name assigned by the field team, and afterward with a scientific name assigned by a botanist during regular botanical campaigns. Botanical campaigns have been carried out every 5 to 6 years from 2003 onwards. These changes in identification protocol raised methodological issues as vernacular names usually correspond to different botanical species, resulting in significant taxonomic uncertainties that were propagated to composition and diversity metrics. Vernacular names were replaced through multinomial trials <span class="math inline">\(M_v\Big(\big[s_1, s_2, …, s_N\big],\big[\alpha_1, \alpha_2,…, \alpha_3\big]\Big)\)</span> based on the observed association probability <span class="math inline">\(\big[\alpha_1, \alpha_2,…, \alpha_3\big]\)</span> between each vernacular name <em>v</em> and the species <span class="math inline">\(\big[s_1, s_2, …, s_N\big]\)</span> recorded in the inventory. See appendix 1 and <span class="citation">Mélaine Aubry-Kientz et al. (2013)</span> for the detailed methodology. To avoid remaining identification caveats, the simulated botanical inventories were reported at genus level.</p>
<p>Eight functional traits were considered, representing leaf economics (leaves thickness, toughness, total chlorophyll content and specific leaf area), wood economics (wood specific gravity and bark thickness) and life history traits (maximum specific height and seed mass). Traits were exctracted from the BRIDGE project<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> where trait values were measured on nine forest plots infrench guianan, including two in Paracou. Missing trait values of the trait database (10%) were filled by multivariate imputation by chained equation using the Mice r package <span class="citation">(van Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn 2011)</span>. As traits variability was lower within genus and families, we accounted for the phylogenetic signal of the functional traits by restricting the gap filling processes to samples pertaining to the next higher taxonomic level. As seed mass information corresponded to a classification into discrete mass classes, no data filling process was applied so analysis were performed only considering the 414 botanical species of the seed mass dataset.</p>

<div id="recruitment-trajectories" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Recruitment trajectories</h2>
<p>To disentangle the recruitment processes from overall dynamics, communities were split into per-disturbance surviving trees and those recruited since disturbance. Recruited communities were examined either considering the “punctual recruitment”, <em>i.e.</em> recruited trees by 2-year intervals, or all recruits since disturbance as the “accumulated recruits”. Eventually, in disturbed plots the recruited communities were examined distinguishing the undisturbed and logging gap areas to test the validity of recruitment processes for the whole area.</p>
<p>The taxonomic diversity was assessed through Richness and the Hill number translation of Shannon and Simpson indices <span class="citation">(Hill 1973; Chao and Jost 2015; Marcon 2015)</span>.<br />
The three diversities belong to the set of HCDT or generalized entropy, respectively corresponding to the 0, 1 and 2 order of diversity (<em>q</em>), which grasps the balance between richness and evenness in the community through the value of <em>q</em> that emphasizes common species. Functional trajectories were estimated with the Rao quadratic entropy measuring the functional divergence within communities using Gower distance as recommended by <span class="citation">Pavoine et al. (2009)</span>. Functoinal diversity was completed by the trajectories of traits community weighted means (CWM), representing the average trait value in a community weighted by relative abundance of the species carrying each value <span class="citation">(Sandra Díaz et al. 2007; Garnier et al. 2004; Mason et al. 2013)</span>. Seed mass trajectories were reported by the proportion of each class recorded in the inventories. The similarity between the recruited trees and the pre-disturbance forest was measured with the turnover metrics detailed in <span class="citation">Podani, Ricotta, and Schmera (2013)</span>. To estimate the importance of stochastic processes the recruitment was compared to the trajectories of a stochastic model corresponding to random samplings. For the taxonomic trajectories the stochastic model was a random sampling of individual trees according to their observed abundance that preserved species abundance and tree density. For for the functional diversity the stochastic model was a shuffling of functional trait values among species that randomizes abundances across species but within coomunities <span class="citation">(Mason et al. 2013)</span>.</p>
<p>All composition and diversity metrics correspond to the median and 90% percentile obtained after 50 iterations of the taxonomy uncertainty propagation framework and the gap filling process. The stochastic trajectories were similarily obtained after 50 iterations of the random sampling.</p>
