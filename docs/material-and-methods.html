<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Study Site</h2>
<p>The Paracou station is located in a lowland tropical rainforest in French Guiana (518N and 5253W). Climate is tropical wet with mean annual precipitation averaging 2980 mm.yr<sup>-1</sup> (30-yr period) and a 3-months dry season (&lt; 100 mm.mo<sup>-1</sup>) from mid-August to mid-November, and a one-month dry season in March <span class="citation">(Wagner et al. 2011)</span>. The mean annual temperature is 26C. Elevation ranges from 5 to 50 m.</p>
<p> Across all plots, the topography mainly corresponds to hilltops or hillsides, and bottomlands cover less than 1 % of the area. Plots are shallow ferralitic acrisols over a layer of transformed saprolite with low permeability and lateral drainage. Soil conditions are homogeneous, to the exception of the highest hilltops where the thick surface allows a free vertical drainage <span class="citation">(Gourlet-Fleury, Guehl, and Laroussinie 2004)</span>. </p>
<p>The experiment is a network of twelve 6.25 ha plots (Table <a href="#tab:Tab1"><strong>??</strong></a>) that underwent three disturbance treatments in 1987 according to a randomized plot design <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>.</p>
<p> The experiment comprised three replicates of three sylvicultural treatments (hereafter plots T1, T2 and T3) and three control plots (T0). All treatments T1, T2 and T3 comprised the logging of 10 trees/ha with 50 cm minimum DBH that belonged to a set of 58 commercially exploited species <span class="citation">(Gourlet-Fleury, Guehl, and Laroussinie 2004)</span>. Treatment T2 additionally comprised a thinning treatment by poison-girdling of non-commercially exploited species, randomly selected species with an average 30 trees/ha with 40 cm minimum DBH. Treatment T3 additionally comprised the logging of 15 trees /ha with 40 cm minimum DBH and the poison-girdling of 20 trees/ha with a 50 cm minimum DBH, all belonging to non-commercial species. Considering the silvicultural treatments and the following damage, disturbance intensity was measured as the percentage of aboveground standing biomass of trees above 10 cm DBH (%AGB) lost between the first inventory in 1984 and five years after disturbance <span class="citation">(Piponiot et al. 2016)</span>, estimated with the BIOMASS R package <span class="citation">(Réjou-Méchain et al. 2018)</span>, and without accounting for lianas. The three treatments constituted a disturbance intensity gradient with increasing of above-ground biomass (AGB) lost and surface disturbed. </p>

<div id="inventories-protocol-and-dataset-collection" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Inventories Protocol and Dataset Collection</h2>
<p>Dominant families in the study site are <em>Fabaceae</em>, <em>Chrysobalanaceae</em>, <em>Lecythidaceae</em> and <em>Sapotaceae</em>. All trees above 10 cm DBH were mapped and measured annually since 1984. Trees are first identified with a vernacular name assigned by the forest worker team, and afterward with a scientific name assigned by botanists during regular botanical campaigns. Botanical campaigns have been carried out every five to six years from 2003 onwards, but identification levels varied between campaigns.</p>
<p>The variability of protocols in time raised methodological issues as vernacular names usually correspond to different botanical species. This variability resulted in significant taxonomic uncertainties that had to be propagated to composition and diversity metrics. The uncertainty propagation was done through a Bayesian framework reconstituting complete inventories at genus level from real incomplete ones on the basis of vernacular/botanical names association. Vernacular names were replaced through multinomial trials based on the association probability <span class="math inline">\(\big[\alpha_1, \alpha_2,..., \alpha_N\big]\)</span> observed across all inventories between each vernacular name <em>v</em> and the species <span class="math inline">\(\big[s_1, s_2,..., s_N\big]\)</span>:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
M_v\Big(\big[s_1, s_2,..., s_N\big],\big[\alpha_1, \alpha_2,..., \alpha_N\big]\Big) \nonumber
\end{align}\]</span>
<p>See appendix 1 and <span class="citation">Aubry-Kientz et al. (2013)</span> for the detailed methodology.</p>
<p>To minimize the remaining identification uncertainties, the simulated botanical inventories were reported at genus level.</p>
<p>We considered six functional traits representing leaf economics, the leaf thickness, toughness, total chlorophyll content and specific leaf area, and stem economics, the wood specific gravity and bark thickness. These traits were obtained from the BRIDGE project,<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> which proved to reliably assess species functional traits and community functional diversity <span class="citation">(Paine, Baraloto, and Díaz 2015)</span>. Trait values were assessed from a selection of individuals located in nine permanent plots in French Guiana, including two in Paracou, and comprised 294 species belonging to 157 genera.</p>
<p> For the trait value at species level we took the median value of the several trees sampled in the database, which allowed accounting for intraspecific variability although we considered species-level trait values. </p>
<p>Whenever some trait values missed for a species in the trait dataset (10% of the species), missing values were filled using multivariate imputation by chained equation <span class="citation">(van Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn 2011)</span>. To account for the phylogenetic signal in the filling process, imputations based on samples from the same genus or from the same family. Whenever a species was not in the dataset, it was attributed a set of trait values randomly sampled among species of the next higher taxonomic level (same genus or family). Two life-history traits (maximum specific height and seed mass) came from the Mariwenn database.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The database compiles information from a vast literature on the flora of French Guiana <span class="citation">(Ollivier, Baraloto, and Marcon 2007)</span> and comprises 362 species belonging to 188 genera. As seed mass information was classified into classes, no data filling process was applied and analyses were restricted to the botanical species recorded.</p>
<p>All composition and diversity metrics were obtained after 50 iterations of the uncertainty propagation framework.</p>

<div id="recruitment-trajectories" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Recruitment trajectories</h2>
<p> Communities were split into surviving trees of pre-disturbance communities and trees recruited afterward. Trajectories of recruitment diversity (hereafter <span class="math inline">\(H^q_{obs}\)</span>) and turnover started from the first year after disturbance and then considered the trees recruited by 2-years intervals (<em>i.e.</em> for the date Y, the trees that were under 10 cm DBH at Y-1 but above 10 cm DBH at Y). </p>
<p>Trajectories of taxonomic diversity were assessed through species richness and evenness (the Hill number translation of the Simpson index) <span class="citation">(Chao and Jost 2015; Marcon and Hérault 2015)</span>. The two diversities belong to the set of Tsallis or generalized entropy, respectively corresponding to the zero and two order <em>q</em> of diversity that emphasizes common species  regarding their stem density. These two metrics assess community richness and evenness, that reveals the structure of dominance in the community and allow grasping the changes in community abundance distribution. Both metric are complementary to detect the changes in community structure <span class="citation">(Magurran 2004)</span>. </p>
<p>Functional diversity trajectories were assessed through the Rao index of quadratic entropy, which combines species abundance distribution and average pairwise dissimilarity based on all functional traits. Functional composition trajectories were assessed through functional traits Community Weighted Means (CWM). CWM are average trait value in the community weighted by species relative abundance in number of stem <span class="citation">(Díaz et al. 2007)</span>. For graphical representation, CWM trajectories are represented through the fitted lines of generalised additive models adjusted at treatment level <span class="citation">(Wood 2011)</span>. Seed mass trajectories were reported by the stems proportion of each class recorded in the inventories.</p>
<p> The taxonomic similarity between recruited trees and pre-disturbance forest was measured with the relativized abundance replacement measuring species turnover between communities <span class="citation">(Podani, Ricotta, and Schmera 2013)</span>:</p>
<span class="math display" id="eq:formNestedness">\[\begin{equation}
T_{ab}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}|x_i^a - x_i^b| - \bigg| \sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_i^a} - \sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_i^b} \bigg|}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\max{\left( x_i^a;x_i^b \right)}}
\tag{2.1}
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>With <span class="math inline">\(Tab\)</span> the turnover between communities <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> the total number of species in the two communities and <span class="math inline">\(x_{ij}\)</span> the abundance of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in community <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.</p>
<p>The correlation between the initial disturbance intensity and recruited community taxonomic richness and evenness, functional richness and taxonomic turnover were tested through Spearman rank correlation tests. </p>
<p>The observed recruitment trajectories were compared to null trajectories obtained from taxonomic and functional null models. A taxonomic null model was independently built for each plot and for each year. Taxonomic null trajectories were simulated by randomly sampling the recruited trees in the current living community, according to the observed number of recruits. Functional null trajectories were simulated by randomly reassigning the combinations of functional trait values among species. The functional null models maintained the community abundance distribution while randomizing the relative abundance of trait values <span class="citation">(Mason et al. 2013)</span>. Trajectories of null diversity (hereafter <span class="math inline">\(H^q_{null}\)</span>) were similarly obtained after 50 iterations of the random sampling models.</p>

<div id="identification-of-indicative-species" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Identification of indicative species</h2>
<p>We identified characteristic species of post-disturbance recruitment by computing species indicator values for post-disturbance and undisturbed recruited communities. We used the methodology developed in <span class="citation">Dufrêne and Legendre (1997)</span>. Indicator species are defined as the most characteristic species of a group: it would be species only found in that group and recorded in the majority of the plots belonging to this group. All disturbed plots were pooled in the disturbed group and opposed to the undisturbed plots. <span class="math inline">\(IndVal_{ij}\)</span> is the indicator value of species i relative to group j. It is the product of <span class="math inline">\(A_{ij}\)</span>, a measure of species specificity, by <span class="math inline">\(B_{ij}\)</span>, a measure of species fidelity. <span class="math inline">\(A_{ij}\)</span> is the mean abundance of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in each plot <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> of the group compared to all groups in the study. <span class="math inline">\(A_{ij}\)</span> is maximum when species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is only present in group <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(B_{ij}\)</span> is the relative frequency of occurence if species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in the plots of group <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, it is maximum when species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is only present in all plots of group <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
A_{ij} = Nindividuals_{ij} / Nindividuals_{i.}
\end{equation}\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
B_{ij} = Nsites_{ij} / Nsites_{.j}
\end{equation}\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
IndVal_{ij} = A_{ij} x B_{ij} x 100
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>In the formula for <span class="math inline">\(A_{ij}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Nindividuals_{ij}\)</span> is the number of individuals of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in plots of group <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Nindividuals_{i.}\)</span> is the sum of the mean number of individuals of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> over all groups. In the formula for <span class="math inline">\(B_{ij}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Nsites_{ij}\)</span> is the number of plots in group <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> where species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is recorded and <span class="math inline">\(Nsites_{j}\)</span> is the total number of sites. The Indicator Value of a species is the maximum value of <span class="math inline">\(IndVal_{ij}\)</span>, expressed in percentage, observed across all groups. The indicator value is maximal when all individuals of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> are observed in all plots of one group.</p>
<p>The significance of species indicator values was tested through the comparison with a random permutaiton procedure of sites among groups. Observed values were compared to the mean values obtained from 50 random permutations with a z statistic. </p>
