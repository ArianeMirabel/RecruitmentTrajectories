<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Study Site</h2>
<p>The Paracou station is located in a lowland tropical rainforest in French Guiana (518N and 5253W). The climate is tropical wet with mean annual precipitation averaging 2,980 mm.yr-1 (30-yr period) and a 3-month dry season (&lt; 100 mm.mo_{-1}) from mid-August to mid-November and a one-month dry season in March <span class="citation">(Wagner et al. 2011)</span>.
The mean annual temperature is 26. Elevation ranges from 5 to 50 m. Across all the study plots, the topography mainly corresponds to hilltops or hillsides, while bottomlands account for less than 1% of the area. The plots contain shallow ferralitic acrisols over a layer of transformed saprolite with low permeability and lateral drainage. Soil conditions are homogeneous, with the exception of the highest hilltops where the thick surface soil layer allows free vertical drainage <span class="citation">(Gourlet-Fleury, Guehl, and Laroussinie 2004)</span>.
The experiment comprises a network of twelve 6.25 ha plots (Table 1) that underwent three disturbance treatments in 1987 in a randomized plot design <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>.
The experiment comprised three replicates of three sylvicultural treatments (hereafter referred to as plots T1, T2 and T3) and three control plots (T0). All the treatments (T1, T2 and T3) included the logging of 10 trees/ha with 50 cm minimum DBH that belonged to a set of 58 commercially exploited species <span class="citation">(Gourlet-Fleury, Guehl, and Laroussinie 2004)</span>.
Treatment T2 additionally comprised thinning by poison-girdling of non-commercially exploited, randomly selected species with an average 30 trees/ha with 40 cm minimum DBH. Trees subjected to poison-girdling were left standing in the plots. Treatment T3 also included logging of 15 trees/ha with 40 cm minimum DBH and the poison-girdling of 20 trees/ha with a 50 cm minimum DBH, all non-commercial species. Considering the silvicultural treatments and the resulting damage, disturbance intensity was measured as the percentage of aboveground standing biomass of trees above 10 cm DBH (%AGB) lost between the first inventory in 1984 and that conducted five years after the disturbance <span class="citation">(Piponiot et al. 2016)</span> estimated using the BIOMASS R package <span class="citation">(Réjou-Méchain et al. 2017; Réjou-Méchain et al. 2018)</span>, and without accounting for lianas. The three treatments formed a disturbance intensity gradient with increasing loss of above-ground biomass (AGB) and increasing surface area disturbed.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Inventories Protocol and Dataset Collection</h2>
<p>Dominant families in the study site are Fabaceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Lecythidaceae and Sapotaceae. All trees above 10 cm DBH were mapped and measured annually since 1984. The trees are first identified with a vernacular name attributed by the forest worker team, and subsequently with a scientific name assigned by botanists during regular botanical campaigns. Botanical campaigns have been carried out at five to six-year intervals starting in 2003, but identification levels varied between campaigns. The variability of protocols over time raised methodological issues as the vernacular names usually corresponded to different botanical species. This variability resulted in significant taxonomic uncertainties that had to be extended to composition and diversity metrics. Uncertainty propagation was performed using a Bayesian framework that reconstructed complete inventories at species level from real incomplete ones by linking vernacular and botanical names. Vernacular names were replaced through multinomial trials based on the association probability <span class="math inline">\(\big[\alpha_1, \alpha_2,..., \alpha_N\big]\)</span> observed across all inventories between each vernacular name <em>v</em> and the species <span class="math inline">\(\big[s_1, s_2,..., s_N\big]\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
M_v\Big(\big[s_1, s_2,..., s_N\big],\big[\alpha_1, \alpha_2,..., \alpha_N\big]\Big) \nonumber
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>See appendix 1 and <span class="citation">Aubry-Kientz et al. (2013)</span> for the detailed methodology.</p>
<p>We considered six functional traits representing leaf economics, leaf thickness, toughness, total chlorophyll content and specific leaf area, and stem economics, wood specific gravity and bark thickness. These traits were obtained from the BRIDGE project,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>which reliably assessed species functional traits and community functional diversity <span class="citation">(Paine, Baraloto, and Dı́az 2015)</span>.
Trait values were assessed from a selection of individuals located in nine permanent plots in French Guiana, including two in Paracou, and comprised 294 species belonging to 157 genera. For the trait value at species level, we used the median value of several sampled trees in the database.</p>
<p>Whenever trait values for a species were missing in the trait dataset (the case of 10% of the species), the missing values were filled in using multivariate imputation by chained equation <span class="citation">(van Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn 2011)</span>.
To account for the phylogenetic signal in the filling process, imputations were based on samples from the same genus or from the same family. Whenever a species was not present in the dataset, it was attributed a set of trait values randomly sampled among species at the next higher taxonomic level (same genus or family).
Species maximum height came from the Mariwenn database.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>
The database compiles information from a vast literature on the flora of French Guiana <span class="citation">(Ollivier, Baraloto, and Marcon 2007)</span> and comprises 362 species belonging to 188 genera. As seed mass information was classified in classes, no data filling process was applied and analyses were restricted to the botanical species recorded.</p>
<p>All composition and diversity metrics were obtained after 50 iterations of the uncertainty propagation framework.</p>

<div id="recruitment-trajectories" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Recruitment trajectories</h2>
<p>Communities were split into surviving trees from pre-disturbance communities and trees recruited subsequently. Trajectory of recruitment diversity (hereafter <span class="math inline">\(H^q_{obs}\)</span>) and turnover started from the fifth year after disturbance, meaning we considered that tree mortality induced by disturbance had ended <span class="citation">(Piponiot et al. 2016)</span>. Trajectories then considered the trees recruited at 2-years intervals (i.e. for date Y, the trees that were under 10 cm DBH at Y-1 but above 10 cm DBH at Y).</p>
<p>Trajectories of taxonomic diversity were assessed through species richness and evenness (the Hill number translation of the Simpson index) <span class="citation">(Chao and Jost 2015; Marcon and Hérault 2015)</span>.
The two diversities belong to the set of Tsallis or generalized entropy, respectively corresponding to the zero and two order q of diversity that emphasizes species with the species stem density. These two metrics assess community richness and evenness, which in turn, reveal the structure of dominance in the community and allowed us to assess changes in community abundance distribution.
The two diversity metrics will directly be refered as richness and evenness thereafter.
The two metrics are complementary for the detection of changes in community structure <span class="citation">(Magurran 2004)</span>.</p>
<p>Functional diversity trajectories were assessed using the Rao index of quadratic entropy, which combines species abundance distribution and average pairwise dissimilarity based on all functional traits:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H_\Delta(P) = \sum_{s&#39;}\sum_{s&#39;&#39;}p_{s&#39;}p_{s&#39;&#39;}d_{s&#39;s&#39;&#39;}\]</span>
With <span class="math inline">\(p_{s&#39;}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(p_{s&#39;&#39;}\)</span> the frequency of species <span class="math inline">\(s&#39;\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s&#39;&#39;\)</span> in the community <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> the functional dissimilarity matrix which elements <span class="math inline">\(d_{s&#39;s&#39;&#39;}\)</span> are the euclidean distance between species measured from species trait values.</p>
<p>Functional composition trajectories were assessed through community weighted means (CWM) of functional traits. CWM are average trait values in the community weighted by the species relative abundance of the number of stems <span class="citation">(Dı́az et al. 2007)</span>.
In the graphs (Figure 2), CWM trajectories are represented by the fitted lines of generalized additive models (GAM) adjusted at treatment level. GAM make it possible to represent the non-linear response of a variable, here, the functional trait value, as the addition of basic smoothing functions. The number of smoothing functions and the smoothing parameters were selected using the restricted maximum likelihood method in the gmcv R package <span class="citation">(Wood 2011)</span>.
A table of trait correlations is provided in supplementary material (Table S1) for a better overview of the trade-offs among traits.
The taxonomic similarity between recruited trees and the pre-disturbance community was measured with the relativized abundance replacement measuring species turnover between communities <span class="citation">(Podani, Ricotta, and Schmera 2013)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:formNestedness">\[\begin{equation}
T_{ab}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}|x_i^a - x_i^b| - \bigg| \sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_i^a} - \sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_i^b} \bigg|}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\max{\left( x_i^a;x_i^b \right)}}
\tag{2.1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>With <span class="math inline">\(T_{ab}\)</span> the turnover between communities <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> the total number of species in the two communities and <span class="math inline">\(x_{i}^{j}\)</span> the abundance of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in community <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.</p>
<p>Spearman correlation tests assessed the correlations between percentage of AGB lost following disturbance and diversity and composition changes. Specifically, changes in taxonomic richness, taxonomic evenness, and functional richness were assessed as the maximum difference over the 30 years between observed and pre-disturbance values and between observed and null models values. Changes in taxonomic turnover were assessed as the maximum taxonomic turnover value over the 30 years.</p>
<p>The observed recruitment trajectories were compared to null trajectories obtained from the taxonomic and functional null models detailed below. A taxonomic null model was built independently for each plot and each year. Taxonomic null trajectories were simulated by randomly sampling the recruited trees in the current living community, according to the observed number of recruits. This model aimed to simulate a neutral assemblage of species, <em>i.e.</em> regardless of species trait values, without questioning the manifold processes that shape community diversity distribution. Functional null trajectories were simulated by randomly reassigning the combinations of functional trait values among species. The functional null models maintained the community abundance distribution while randomizing the relative abundance of trait values <span class="citation">(Mason et al. 2013)</span>.
Trajectories of null diversity (hereafter <span class="math inline">\(H^q_{null}\)</span>) were similarly obtained after 50 iterations of the random sampling models.
For each iteration of the null model, we computed the difference between null and observed trajectories. The 50 iterations made it possible to calculate a 95% confidence interval of the difference between null and observed trajectories.</p>
<p>Post-disturbance diversity, composition, and turnover trajectories were analyzed via breakpoints analysis to detect the shifts in community post-disturbance response. We fit linear regression models to the trajectories, segmented according to one or two varying shifting times. The segmented models with the lower mean square error were retained for each trajectory.</p>
