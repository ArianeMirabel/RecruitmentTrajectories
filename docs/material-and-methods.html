<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Study Site</h2>
<p>The Paracou station is located in a lowland tropical rainforest in French Guiana (518N and 5253W). Climate is tropical wet with mean annual precipitation averaging 2980 mm.y<sup>-1</sup> (30-y period) and a 3-months dry season (&lt; 100 mm.months<sup>-1</sup>) from mid-August to mid-November, and a one-month dry season in March <span class="citation">(Wagner et al. 2011)</span>. Elevation ranges from 5 to 50 m and mean annual temperature is 26C. Soils are thin acrisols over a layer of transformed saprolite with low permeability generating lateral drainage during heavy rains. The experiment is a network of twelve 6.25ha plots (Table <a href="#tab:Tab1"><strong>??</strong></a>) that underwent three disturbance treatments in 1987 according to a randomized plot design with three replicate blocks of four plots <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Inventories Protocol and Dataset Collection</h2>
<p>Dominant families in the study site are Fabaceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Lecythidaceae and Sapotaceae. All trees above 10 cm DBH were mapped and measured annually since 1984. Trees are first identified with a vernacular name assigned by the forest worker team, and afterward with a scientific name assigned by botanists during regular botanical campaigns. Botanical campaigns have been carried out every 5 to 6 years from 2003 onwards but identification levels varied between campaigns.</p>
<p>These variability of protocols in time raised methodological issues as vernacular names usually correspond to different botanical species. It resulted in significant taxonomic uncertainties that had to be propagated to composition and diversity metrics. The uncertainty propagation was done through a Bayesian framework reconstituting complete inventories at genus level from real incomplete ones on the basis of vernacular/botanical names association. Vernacular names were replaced through multinomial trials based on the association probability <span class="math inline">\(\big[\alpha_1, \alpha_2,..., \alpha_3\big]\)</span> observed across all inventories between each vernacular name <em>v</em> and the species <span class="math inline">\(\big[s_1, s_2,..., s_N\big]\)</span>:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
M_v\Big(\big[s_1, s_2,..., s_N\big],\big[\alpha_1, \alpha_2,..., \alpha_3\big]\Big) \nonumber
\end{align}\]</span>
<p>See appendix 1 and <span class="citation">Aubry-Kientz et al. (2013)</span> for the detailed methodology.</p>
<p>To minimize the remaining identification uncertainties, the simulated botanical inventories were reported at genus level.</p>
<p>Six functional traits representing the leaf economics (leaves thickness, toughness, total chlorophyll content and specific leaf area) and stem economics spectra (wood specific gravity and bark thickness), and life-history traits (maximum specific height and seed mass) were considered. Traits were extracted from the BRIDGE project<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> where trait values were assessed from a selection of individuals located in nine permanent plots in French Guiana, including two in Paracou, and comprised 294 species pertaining to 157 genera. Missing trait values (10%) were filled by multivariate imputation by chained equation <span class="citation">(van Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn 2011)</span>. Imputations were restricted within genus or family when samples were too scarce, in order to account for the phylogenetic signal.<br />
As seed mass information was classified into classes, no data filling process was applied and analyses were restricted to the 414 botanical species recorded.</p>
<p>All composition and diversity metrics were obtained after 50 iterations of the uncertainty propagation framework.</p>

<div id="recruitment-trajectories" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Recruitment trajectories</h2>
<p>Communities were split into surviving trees of pre-disturbance communities and trees recruited afterward in 2-years intervals.</p>
<p>Taxonomic diversity trajectories were assessed through species richness and evenness (the Hill number translation of the Simpson index) <span class="citation">(Chao and Jost 2015; Marcon 2015)</span>.<br />
The two diversities belong to the set of HCDT or generalized entropy, respectively corresponding to the 0 and 2 order of diversity (<em>q</em>), which grasps the balance between richness and evenness in the community through the value of <em>q</em> that emphasizes common species.</p>
<p>Functional diversity trajectories were assessed through the Rao index of quadratic entropy, which combines species abundance distribution and average pairwise dissimilarity based on all functional traits. Functional composition trajectories were assessed through the functional traits community weighted means (CWM), representing the average trait value in a community weighted by species relative abundance <span class="citation">(Díaz et al. 2007)</span>. Seed mass trajectories were reported by the proportion of each class recorded in the inventories (Annexe I).</p>
<p>The taxonomic similarity between recruited trees and pre-disturbance forest was measured with the turnover metrics detailed in <span class="citation">Podani, Ricotta, and Schmera (2013)</span>.</p>
<p>The taxonomic and functional recruitment trajectories were compared to null trajectories obtained after 50 iterations of the null models. The taxonomic null model was a random sampling of recruited trees within the living communities, with the maintenance of species abundance and tree density. The functional null model was a reassignment of species trait values that randomized traits abundances but maintained communities abundance distribution <span class="citation">(Mason et al. 2013)</span>. The null trajectories were similarily obtained after 50 iterations of the random sampling.</p>
