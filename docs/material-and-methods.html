<p><em>Study Site</em> \ Analyses were based on the inventories conducted at the Paracou station in French Guiana (5°18’N and 52°53’W) in a lowland tropical rain forest. The site corresponds to a tropical wet climate with mean annual precipitation averaging 2980 mm.y-1 (30-y period) with a 3-months dry season (&lt; 100 mm.months-1) from mid-August to mid-November, and a one-month dry season in march. Elevation ranges between 5 and 50 m and mean annual temperature is 26°C. Soils correspond to thin acrisols over a layer of transformed saprolite with low permeability generating lateral drainage during heavy rains. The experiment corresponds to a network of twelve 6.25ha plots where three logging treatments representing a gradient of logging intensity were applied from 1985 to 1987. Logging treatments were attributed according to a randomized plot design with three replicate blocks of four plots. The logging treatments correspond to averages of 10 trees remove per hectare with a diameter at 1.3 m height (DBH) above 50 cm for treatment 1 (T1), 32 trees/ha above 40 cm DBH for treatment 2 (T2) and 40 trees above 40 cm DBH for treatment 3 (T3). Treatments T2 and T3 included besides logging of 10trees/ha the thinning by poison girdling.</p>
<p><em>Inventories Protocol and Dataset Collection</em> \ The study site corresponds to a tropical rain forest with a dominance of Fabaceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Lecythidaceae and Sapotaceae. In the twelve experimental plots all trees above 10 cm DBH are mapped and measured annually since 1984, which allows to survey the trees recruited annually. During the inventories trees are first identified with a vernacular name, assigned by the field team, and then with a scientific name, assigned by a botanist during regular botanical campaigns. In 1984, specific vernacular names were given to 62 commercial or common species whereas two identifiers separating palm trees and trees were given to all other species. Botanical campaigns to identify all trees at the species level started in 2003 and continued every 5 to 6. In total from 1984 to 2016 around 850 species were identified in the 12 plots. For the trees that were identified at the species level vernacular names attributed in the first place generate some taxonomic uncertainty as they may correspond to a variety of botanical species. To account for this taxonomic uncertainty in the composition and diversity metrics we used a Bayesian framework estimating the expectancy and variance of composition and diversity metrics. The frameworks is based on a set of complete inventories extrapolated from the initial one through the replacement of vernacular name by botanical species. These replacement were made through a multinomial distribution M<sub>v</sub>([s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>, …, s<sub>N</sub>] ,[α<sub>1</sub>, α<sub>2</sub>,…, α<sub>N</sub>]) based on the observed association probability [α<sub>1</sub>, α<sub>2</sub>,…, α<sub>N</sub>] between each vernacular name v and the species recorded in the inventory [s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>, …, s<sub>N</sub>]. See appendix 1 for the detailed methodology. Diversity metrics correspond to the expectancy obtained after 50 iteration of the taxonomic uncertainty propagation framework.</p>
<em>Recruitment Survey</em> \ To assess the demographic dynamics along the 30 sampled year we divided the inventoried trees between trees recorded before the logging in 1984 and the trees recruited afterward. Analysis first surveyed the communities of trees recruited every 3 years-laps after exploitation, hereafter called “punctual recruitment”. Then to assess the diversity of the stands under settlement analysis surveyed the communities of recruited trees accumulated since exploitation, hereafter called “accumulated recruits”. The taxonomic diversity was assessed through Richness and the Hill number translation of Shannon and Simpson indices. To tackle the unequal number of recruited trees among treatments the indices bias corrected estimator were used, following . These three indices belong to the set of HCDT or generalized entropy, respectively corresponding to the 0, 1 and 2 order of diversity (q). This order q grasps the balance between richness and evenness in the community as it determines the emphasis on common species in the diversity metric, with common species weighting more than rare ones when q increases. The similarity between the recruited trees and the old growth forest was measured with the turnover metrics detailed in <span class="citation">Podani, Ricotta, et Schmera (2013)</span>. The metric used correspond to the relativized abundance replacement, the sum of abundance in one site that is replaced by completely different species, normalized by the maximum abundance shared by the two communities.
<span class="math display" id="eq:TurnoverFormula">\[\begin{equation}
T_ab=\frac{\sum{\limits_{i=1}^{n}|x_ia - x_ib |} -|\sum{\limits{i=1}^{n} x_ia }- \sum{\limits{i=1}^{n} x_ib} |}{\sum{{i=1}^{n}max{x_ia;x_ib }} 
\tag{2.1}
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>To determine whether trees recruitment ensued from a random process the observed diversity trajectories were compared to those generated by 50 repetitions of stochastic null models. The null model for taxonomic diversity randomly shuffled individuals among plots while preserving species abundance and plots’ tree density.</p>
