<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Determining the response of tropical forests to disturbance is key to understand the ecological rules that shape them. This prospect yielded a vast literature which successfully defined and modeled the response of important forest features and functions such as carbon sequestration, commercial stocks, and diameter distribution dynamics in the short and in the long term <span class="citation">(Gourlet-Fleury et Houllier 2000; F. E. Putz et al. 2012; Martin et al. 2015; Vidal, West, et Putz 2016)</span>. Similar approach for stand communities diversity, though, has been hindered by both the huge biological diversity of tropical forests and the scarcity of long-term monitoring. Although the response to disturbance was identified for some species individually, this requires accurate ecological knowledge of the species and usually confined to commercial and valuable tree species <span class="citation">(Sebbenn et al. 2008; Rozendaal, Soliz-Gamboa, et Zuidema 2010; Vinson et al. 2015)</span>. The overall response of taxonomic and functional diversity of forest communities therefore remains unclear, and thus also the underlying ecological rules.</p>
<p>Diversity dynamics of tropical forest communities are largely determined by the recruitment dynamics that drive the amount and the species of trees growing and surviving until the adult stage. These dynamics rely upon the disturbance regime which, in changing ecosystem’s biotic and abiotic conditions, creates an environmental variability that allows a variety of species to strive in the long term despite the competition for resources among species that may exclude them <span class="citation">(Denslow 1980)</span>. This principle underlies the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH) that explains the origin and maintenance of tropical forests biodiversity by the patchy variability of environmental conditions in space and time following climate irregularity, random tree fall gaps, etc. This variability, when not too intense or frequent as to set up strong environmental filters, is assumed to enlarge the ecological range of species in the community <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino et Sabatier 2001; Bongers et al. 2009)</span> and shapes its taxonomic diversity, vegetative structure, physiology and cycles of carbon, nutrients, and water <span class="citation">(Anderson-Teixeira et al. 2013)</span>. Empirical tests of the IDH in tropical rainforests,though, proved hard to setup and yielded controversial results <span class="citation">(Hubbell et al. 1999; J. F. Molino et Sabatier 2001; Sheil et Burslem 2003)</span>. Latests studies on this matter supported the IDH in proving the significant impact of disturbance, in the form of tree fall gaps and consecutive environmental changes, on the diversity and taxonomic composition of tropical forests communities. Disturbance indeed proved to prompt some environmental filters selecting species with fast and efficient resource acquisition <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012, Mirabel2018,in prep.)</span>. At the whole plot level the shift towards more acquisitive functional strategies was reflected by functional traits of the leaves (Leaf thickness, toughness, chlorophyll content and specific area) and stem (wood specific gravity and bark thickness) and life traits (maximum hight at adult stage and class of seed mass) <span class="citation">(I. J. Wright et al. 2004; J. Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011)</span>. Within these whole plot dynamics the share hold by the recruitment and mortality processes remains to be determined, first to establish if environmental filters rather influence the growth and survival of some species or the mortality of some others, then to anticipate the prfile of the forest being put in place and specifically its taxonomic and functional structure. Desentangle the impacts of disturbance on recruitment and mortality would resolve the dynamics of stands’recovery and debate about the characteristics of the post-disturbance forests-to-be. This would give insights into the future conservation or even commercial value of forests, according to their composition regarding rare or commercial species <span class="citation">(S Díaz et al. 2005; Gardner et al. 2007; Schwartz, Falkowski, et Peña-Claros 2017)</span>. It would besides elucidate the determinism of tropical forests trajectories that would mean the convergence after disturbance of taxonomic and functional communities towards initial state. Under the convergence perspective the recruitment would be fully nested within the initial inventory and the forests-to-be would more and more resemble the pre-disturbance state <span class="citation">(Meiners et al. 2015; Li et al. 2016)</span>.</p>
<p>In this paper we analysed in a neotropical forest the diversity trajectories of recruited trees over 30 years after a gradient of disturbance, with 10 to 60% of ecosystem biomass removed. We assessed the taxonomic as well as functional diversity of recruited trees, using a large functional traits database browsing major leaf, stem and seed traits and species maximum height We aimed to (i) confirm the role of environmental filters selecting the recruited trees according to their competitivity for resource acquisition, (ii) resolve the convergence of communities and the maintenance of taxonomic composition in the long term, and (iii) determine the resilience of the initial pre-distirbance .</p>
