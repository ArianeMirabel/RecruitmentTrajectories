QUESTIONS The role of tree diversity in tropical forests functioning and ecosystem services provision means tree diversity and composition are crucial under the global changing context. Long-term community response to disturbance is known to follow manifold successional pathways driven by the interplay between deterministic and stochastic processes. In the very diverse tropical forests, focusing on recruitment processes allows a long-term analysis of forest response to disturbance, given that the future forest communities will be composed of the currently recruited cohorts. Post-disturbance recruitment trajectories should allow to (i) distinguish the determinants of tree recruitment between stochastic and deterministic processes that enhance a restricted pool of species and (ii) investigated whether taxonomic and functional diversity of recruitment processes returned to pre-disturbance state. LOCATION Amazonian rainforest, Paracou station, French Guiana. METHODS We examined the trajectories of taxonomic and functional diversity of recruited trees over a period of 30 years in twelve forest plots each 6.25 ha in size following a disturbance gradient from 0 to 60% of above-ground biomass removed. We analyzed taxonomic richness, evenness, and turnover, and functional diversity and composition considering seven leaf, stem and life-history functional trait. RESULTS We reveal a two-phase successional pathway defined by the emergence of deterministic recruitment processes temporarily offsetting the stochastic pre-disturbance processes. Succession resulted in an enhanced recruitment of light-demanding species which, above a disturbance intensity threshold, became dominant until the recovery of the pre-disturbance taxonomic and functional characteristics and of stochastic recruitment processes. CONCLUSIONS We observed a tangible but decades-long return to the pre-disturbance diversity and composition of recruitment processes regarding taxonomic characteristics and functional characteristics based on seven key functional traits. Post-disturbance recruitment would be driven by the emergence of competition processes, favoring species with efficient light use and acquisition, gradually offsetting the stochastic recruitment at stake in undisturbed communities. Although returning towards pre-disturbance values, recruitment taxonomic and functional characteristics were altered for more than 30 years.

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Determining the response of tropical forests to disturbance is a key to predicting their fate in the context of global climate change. In recent decades, tropical forests have experienced a wide range of disturbances, from radical land-use changes for agriculture or mining <span class="citation">(Dezécache, Faure, et al. 2017; Dezécache, Salles, et al. 2017)</span> to more insidious changes following climate change or human activities like selective logging <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012; Aubry-Kientz et al. 2015)</span>.
In that respect a vast literature has successfully modeled community response to disturbance in terms of tree growth, tree height and fluxes of carbon, water and nutrients <span class="citation">(Gourlet-Fleury and Houllier 2000; Putz et al. 2012; Piponiot et al. 2016; Rutishauser et al. 2016)</span>.
Tree community diversity and composition, however, proved more complex to predict as both deterministic and stochastic processes drive forests succession <span class="citation">(Norden et al. 2015)</span>.
Deterministic successional pathways, hypothesized to follow the variations in resource availability, would involve a succession of recruitment processes depending on the species use of resources and competitive abilities <span class="citation">(Clements 1916; Meiners et al. 2015)</span>.
Such deterministic succession would shape predictable trajectories gradually restoring the pre-disturbance state of the community <span class="citation">(Chesson 2000; Rees et al. 2001; Adler, HilleRislambers, and Levine 2007)</span>.
Specifically, for tree species communities, deterministic pathways would first involve the recruitment of saplings benefiting from higher resources availability and reduced competition. Then, stand maturation would progressively enforce the exclusion of low-competitive species until early-successional species are replaced by late-successional ones driving towards the recovery of pre-disturbance composition and diversity <span class="citation">(Denslow and Guzman 2000)</span>.
Along with deterministic recruitment, stochastic processes are known to drive tree community response to disturbance.
Stochastic processes would imply a much higher variability of post-disturbance trajectories <span class="citation">(Brokaw and Busing 2000; Norden et al. 2015)</span>, and may lead towards new equilibrium states instead of fully recovering their pre-disturbance state <span class="citation">(Hubbell 2001; Chave 2004)</span>.
The relative importance of stochastic and deterministic processes largely depends on the environmental and historical context <span class="citation">(Chazdon 2008; Norden et al. 2015)</span>.
In the very diverse tropical forests, several studies revealed predictable and homogeneous successional patterns restoring pre-disturbance community characteristics <span class="citation">(Norden et al. 2009; Letcher et al. 2015)</span>, while other revealed diverging post disturbance trajectories and different equilibrium states <span class="citation">(Longworth et al. 2014)</span>.
Various entangled processes determine tree community dynamics. Among them, recruitment is crucial for the maintenance of community diversity and composition, and may also be an important source of variability <span class="citation">(Grubb 1977; Hurtt and Pacala 1995; Clark, Macklin, and Wood 1998)</span>.
We aimed here to assess the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic recruitment processes in the response of a Neotropical forest to disturbance, and its recovery towards pre-disturbance state.</p>
<p>Two major facets of communities description are their taxonomic characteristics, corresponding species composition and diversity, and their functional characteristics, accounting for species ecology and functioning <span class="citation">(MacArthur and Levins 1967; Violle et al. 2007; Kunstler et al. 2016)</span>.
Deterministic processes correspond to a recruitment depending on species competitive ability determined by their functional characteristics <span class="citation">(Rees et al. 2001; Perronne et al. 2017)</span>.
Light being hypothesized as the limiting resource in tropical forests, deterministic processes are thought to drive functional succession from fast-growing species with “acquisitive” resource use, capable of significant and rapid acquisition of light, to slow-growing, long-lived species with “conservative” resource use <span class="citation">(Denslow 1980; Molino and Sabatier 2001; Bongers et al. 2009)</span>.
Deterministic processes might be revealed by community functional trajectories regarding key leaf, wood and life-history functional traits assessing species ecology resources acquisition strategy <span class="citation">(Wright et al. 2004; Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011)</span>.
Stochastic processes, in turn, which correspond to a species recruitment independent of their functional characteristics would translate into random taxonomic trajectories unrelated functional trajectories.
A combination of taxonomic and functional approaches could thus reveal both deterministic and stochastic recruitment processes driving community response to disturbance <span class="citation">(Fukami et al. 2005; Chalmandrier et al. 2015; Cequinel et al. 2018)</span>.</p>
<p>Here, we followed recruitment trajectories in a 75-ha cumulated area of Neotropical forest plots subject to a gradient of disturbance intensity, between 10% and 60% of above-ground standing biomass removed. We examined community composition, richness, evenness, and turnover of recruited trees over 30-year and compared to the pre-disturbance community. We considered both taxonomic aspects, accounting for tree species diversity and composition, and functional aspects, accounting for seven major leaf, stem, and life-history traits. We compared the recruitment trajectories with neutral models corresponding to stochastic recruitment and a randomization of species functional traits. Specifically, we (i) elucidated the role of deterministic and stochastic processes along post-disturbance successional pathway, and (ii) clarified the return of recruitment processes to pre-disturbance values of taxonomic and functional diversity and composition.</p>
