<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Taxonomic richness and evenness, and functional diversity</h2>
<p>The average number of recruited trees per plot and per year throughout the survey increased with increasing disturbance intensity. Over the 30-year period, across the 12 plots, recruited trees belonged to 602 different species. Among these species, 26% only occurred in one plot and 7% occurred in all plots.</p>
<p>The analysis framework handling botanical uncertainties returned the estimation and significance of the diversity metrics: overall, the 95% confidence interval remained below 10% of the estimated value. As visualized in the figures, taxonomic diversity estimations showed significantly distinct trajectories among plots with no overlapping confidence intervals (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:DivTraj">3.1</a> a &amp; b). Functional trajectories were not as distinctly separated, but the confidence intervals also comprised the variability associated with the estimation of missing functional trait values (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:DivTraj">3.1</a> c).</p>
<p>In undisturbed communities, the taxonomic richness and evenness of the recruited trees remained stable over the 30-year period, with values equivalent to those of the taxonomic null model (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:DivTraj">3.1</a>).</p>
<p>In disturbed communities, the taxonomic richness followed hump-shaped trajectories first increasing and reaching maximum after around 15 years. This maximum was positively correlated with disturbance intensity (<span class="math inline">\(\rho^{Richness}_{spearman}=0.87\)</span>).
Taxonomic richness then decreased and recovered pre-disturbance values after 30 years.
Compared to the null models, the observed taxonomic richness in disturbed plots was significantly lower than the richness of random species recruitment. The confidence interval of the difference between observed and null models remained well under zero in all disturbed plots.
In all disturbed communities, the taxonomic evenness decreased whenever the disturbance intensity over the 30 years, but the maximum decrease was weakly correlated with disturbance intensity (<span class="math inline">\(\rho^{simpson}_{spearman}=0.03\)</span>).
Compared to the null model, the observed taxonomic evenness was significantly lower than the evenness of a random species recruitment. The difference between the observed and null model evenness followed a hump-shaped trajectory where maximum difference was reached around 25 years after the original disturbance. The maximum difference with null model was positively correlated with disturbance intensity regarding taxonomic richness (<span class="math inline">\(\rho^{Richness}_{spearman}=0.83\)</span>), and evenness (<span class="math inline">\(\rho^{Simpson}_{spearman}=0.45\)</span>).
The confidence interval of the difference between null and observed trajectories remained well below zero in all the disturbed plots.
The shifting point analysis of taxonomic richness and evenness trajectories revealed a single shifting point for both trajectories, occurring for disturbed communities between 15 and 20 years following disturbance for the taxonomic richness and between 10 and 23 years following disturbance for taxonomic evenness (Supp Mat, Fig.S1).</p>
<p>The functional diversity in the undisturbed plots remained stable and equivalent to that of the functional null model over the 30-year period. In the plots with the least disturbance, functional diversity remained stable or increased slightly and was higher than that of the null model in two of the T1 plots.
The maximum change in community functional diversity over the 30 years was positively correlated with the disturbance intensity (<span class="math inline">\(\rho^{FunctionalDiversity}_{spearman}=0.64\)</span>).
In disturbed plots with higher disturbance intensity (T2 and T3), functional diversity decreased until 15 years after disturbance, and then started to recover initial values. The observed functional diversity remained lower than that of the null model over the 30-year period.
However, the difference between null and observed functional trajectories was only significant in the most highly disturbed plots (T3). The maximum difference between observed and null trajectories was positively correlated with the disturbance intensity (<span class="math inline">\(\rho^{FunctionalDiversity}_{spearman}=0.68\)</span>).
The shifting points analysis of functional diversity revealed a single shifting point occurring from 10 to 23 years following disturbance (Supp Mat, Fig.S1).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Species composition</h2>
<p>In all, 602 species were recorded over the 30 years of inventory and across the 12 plots. Among species, 157 were only inventoried in one plot and 43 were inventoried in all plots.
The detailed species distribution and the complete list of species inventoried is provided in supplementary material are presented in supplementary material (Table S2 and Table S3). The dominant recruited species were <em>Lecythis persistens</em>, <em>Licania alba</em>, <em>Oenocarpus bataua</em>, <em>Oxandra asbeckii</em>, and <em>Eperua grandiflora</em>.
The dominant species recruited in disturbed plots were <em>Miconia tschudyoides</em>, <em>Inga sp.</em>, <em>Oenocarpus bataua</em>, <em>Licania alba</em>, and <em>Xylopia sp.</em>.
We besides analyzed the dominant species of recruited communities in disturbed plots, considering for each plot the years before the shifting point on the one hand, and the years after the shifting point on the other hand.
During the years before shifting, the dominant species recruited in disturbed plots were <em>Vismia</em> spp., <em>Cecropia obtusa</em>, <em>Oxandra asbeckii</em>, <em>Cecropia sciadophylla</em>, and <em>Lecythis persistens</em>. From the years following the shifting point, the dominant species were <em>Miconia tschudyoides</em>, <em>Miconia acuminata</em>, <em>Oenocarpus bataua</em>, <em>Oxandra asbeckii</em>, and <em>Xylopia nitida</em>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Functional composition</h2>
<p>Functional traits in undisturbed plots remained stable over the 30-year period whereas in all the disturbed plots, with the exception of leaf chlorophyll content, the trajectories were hump-shaped. The trajectories of SLA and bark thickness initially increased before decreasing towards initial values. Conversely, trajectories of leaf thickness, leaf toughness, wood specific gravity, and maximum height first decreased and then started returning to their initial values but their recovery was still not complete at the end of the 30-year period (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:CWM">3.2</a>).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Recruitment Turnover</h2>
<p>The turnover of recruited species in control plots compared to the initial community remained low over the 30-year period (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:Turnover">3.3</a>).
In disturbed plots the turnover of the recruited species followed a marked hump-shaped trajectory, with a maximum reached about 15 years after the disturbance. The maximum turnover was positively correlated with disturbance intensity (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}=0.93\)</span>).
The shifting points analysis of taxonomic turnover revealed a single shifting point occurring from 17 to 23 years following disturbance (Supp Mat, Fig.S1).
Thirty years after the disturbance, the turnover had returned to low values.</p>
