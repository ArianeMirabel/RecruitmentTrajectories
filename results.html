<p><strong>Recruitment Diversity</strong></p>
<p><em>Punctual and accumulated recruitsâ€™ diversity</em></p>
<p>The diversity of trees recruited in T1, T2 and T3 logged plots first constituted a community with higher richness and lower evenness than in control plots until 25 years after disturbance. From then on, disturbed plots displayed lower richness and lower evenness than control ones. <em>The OLS analysis proved a significant time-dependence of the punctual recruitment diversity for the three diversity order, Richness, Shannon and Simpson and a significant effect of the logging treatment (P&lt;0.01 in any case). It besides proved a significant time-dependence of the accumulated recruitment diversity for the three order and a significant effect of the logging.</em></p>

<p><em>Comparison to null model</em></p>
<p>Punctual and accumulated recruitment diversity of order 0, 1 and 2 were compared to a null recruitment model corresponding to the random sampling of recruited trees holding constant the effectives of trees recruited. For control plots the richness and evenness of observed punctual recruitment were constantly equivalent or higher than obtained with the null model <a href="results.html#fig:Fig2">3.2</a>. For the disturbed plots the richness of observed punctual recruitment remained equivalent to this of the null model, however the evenness that was first equivalent or higher became lower than this of the null model from 10 years after disturbance whenever the disturbance intensity.</p>

<p>In the same way as for punctual recruitment the richness and evenness of accumulated recuits in control plots was equivalent or higher than observed for the null model for all the post logging survey. On disturbed plaots the richness of accumulated recruits followed this of the null model whereas the evenness, initially higher, became lower than this of the null model after some time <a href="results.html#fig:Fig3">3.3</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Recruitment Turnover</strong></p>
<p>The abundance turnover of recruited trees compared to the initial stand inventoried before exploitation remained even for the 30 sampled years in the control plots <a href="results.html#fig:Fig6">3.6</a>. For the disturbed plot the abundance turnover displayed a humped-back trajectory with maximum reached around 10 years after disturbance that was positively correlated to the disturbance intensity.
