<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Discussion</h1>
<p>From the 30 years of forest dynamics survey in the Paracou station, we highlighted contrasting recruitment patterns depending on disturbance intensity. Disturbance increased the recruitment rate which subsequently increased the richness of recruitment but impaired its evenness, all the more so that disturbance intensity was high. After disturbance the recruitment was dominated by a restricted pool of species and Shannon and Simpson diversities decreased down to lower values than those of control plots.</p>
<div id="on-the-underlyings-of-the-hump-shaped-trajectories" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> On the underlyings of the hump-shaped trajectories</h2>
<p>Punctual recruitment, some key functional traits (SLA, leaf thickness) and turn-over trajectories exhibited hump-shaped curves so that, for the 10-15 first years following disturbance, recruitment processes seemed first driven by the growth of pre-disturbance saplings that benefitted from the environmental changes <span class="citation">(Herault et al. 2010)</span> and progressively incorporated true recruits, i.e. individual trees that had germinated after the disturbance. This translated by a regular increase in functional diversity of recruits in the early times. According to the SLA trajectory (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:Fig4">3.4</a>), these true recruits are mainly pionneer species that dominate the recruited community 12 years after disturbance.</p>
<p>After this first recruitment phase, in the case of low disturbance intensity (T1 plots) the recruitment was higly similar to the pre-disturbance community as revealed by the random sampling. This argues for the existence of recruitment limitation in the medium-term <em>????meaning the strive of a variety of species, even when not the most fitted for the environmental context, because the best competitors couldn’t set in disturbed area???? to be rewritten</em>. The key role of recruitment limitation in recovery dynamic was already highlighted for low disturbance intensity in tropical wet forests <span class="citation">(Hubbell et al. 1999; Sheil and Burslem 2003; Bongers et al. 2009)</span> and supported the IDH as it mitigates competitive exclusion and maintains some inferior competitiors in the community. Recruitment and dispersal limitation are consistent with the short dispersal distance observed for tropical trees, and it was already highlighted in Paracou through the genetic clumping observed for some pioneers <span class="citation">(Leclerc et al. 2015; Scotti et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>In the case of high disturbance intensity, the species turnover remains very high after the initial 10 year phasis and the functional diversity decreased sharply, along a general functional shift towards acquisitive functional strategies. This was marked for nearly all functional traits of the leaf and stem and for life history traits (Leaf thickness, Wood Specific Gravity and Hmax) which values represented a community of fast-growing long-lived species with a high resources acquisition strategies <span class="citation">(I. J. Wright et al. 2004; J. Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011; Reich 2014)</span>. The time elpased between disturbance and the significance of those functional and diversity shifts suggests that the second recruitment phase stems from the germination of long-lived pioneers at the moment of the disturbance. <em>here i think that we are seeing the effect of long-lived pioneers, and this should be discusssed. especially the functional differences between long- and short-lived pioneers</em></p>
<p><em>?????Eventually, we observed that disturbance induced particular recruitment mechanisms but also set aside mechanisms at stake in natural plots.????</em></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> On the resilience of the recruitment</h2>
<p>After 30 years stands functional characteristics had recovered whatever the disturbance intensity but significant taxonomic diversity difference persisted when the disturbance intensity was high. Stands functioning would then recover faster than taxonomic composition, which questions the recovery and the role of functional redundancy regarding tropical forests diversity. In any case, the recruitment turnover compared to initial stand ended up close to zero. This argued for the maintenance or for the recovery in relation to the stand <span class="citation">(Anderson 2007)</span> of the before-disturbance environment. It also supported the convergence of communities tree species taxonomic and functional composition in the long term <span class="citation">(Li et al. 2016)</span>. The communities recruited after disturbance would then persist for more than 30 years as suggested by the remaining difference among treatments but the initial recruitment dynamics seemed restored at this point, ensuring communities resilience if no other disturbance is applied. The different results of two studies on the same site 10 years <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span> and 20 years <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span> after logging already suggested the recovery towards initial taxonomic and functional condition of the stands in revealing a decreasing proportion of pioneers between the two periods. This is however only valid for a single disturbance event, given that second recruitment phase assumed to rely on the seed bank triggers a storage effect likely to modify the trajectories after another disturbance event. We assume that in this case the competitive exclusion among dormant life-stage (seeds or even seedlings) would be harsher and bring more radical changes in the recruitment composition and functional profile. Some functional shift towards more acquisitive, small seeded and globally disturbance-resitant species building a more resilient community as it has been observed by <span class="citation">Haddad et al. (2008)</span> who linked the persistence of species to their ability to recover from disturbance which is the seed mass, growth rate linked to WD and SLA for plants. Additionally to a somehow depleted seed bank this strongly questioned the repeatability of observed trajectories after other disturbance events.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>Our long-term study of diversity trajectories after disturbance disentangled the mechanisms underlying stands diversity. While, in undisturbed forests, mechanisms like negative density dependence enhanced species diversity, any disturbance induced new mechanisms depending on the disturbance intensity. In any case, communities short term response first reflected the growth of a variety of already grown saplings which increased the taxonomic and functional evenness of the community. When the disturbance was low, recruitment limitation was balanced against environmental filters and induced a recruited community mirroring the stand in place while selecting more acquisitive functional types. When the disturbance was intense however the species turnover was high and induced a recruited community significantly dominated by acquisitive functional types and a restricted pool of species. In both cases plots recruitment is specific, because it is determined by the surrounding stand in case of low disturbance or because the competitive exclusion randomly selected a restricted pool of species after intense disturbance. At the landscape scale, then, disturbance increased the diversity through the “between patch” difference <span class="citation">(Denslow 1987; Chesson 2000; Sheil and Burslem 2003; Guitet et al. 2017)</span>.</p>
