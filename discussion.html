<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Discussion</h1>
<p>From the 30 years of forest dynamics survey in the Paracou station, we highlighted contrasting recruitment patterns depending on disturbance intensity. Disturbance increased the recruitment rate which subsequently increased the richness of recruitment but impaired its evenness, all the more so that disturbance intensity was high. After disturbance the recruitment was dominated by a restricted pool of species and Shannon and Simpson diversities decreased down to lower values than those of control plots.</p>
<div id="on-the-underlyings-of-the-hump-shaped-trajectories" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> On the underlyings of the hump-shaped trajectories</h2>
<p>Punctual recruitment, some key functional traits (SLA, leaf thickness) and turn-over trajectories exhibited hump-shaped curves so that, for the 10-15 first years following disturbance, recruitment processes seemed first driven by the growth of pre-disturbance saplings that benefitted from the environmental changes <span class="citation">(Herault et al. 2010)</span> and progressively incorporated true recruits, i.e. individual trees that had germinated after the disturbance. This translated by a regular increase in functional diversity of recruits in the early times. According to the SLA trajectory (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:Fig4">3.4</a>), these true recruits are mainly pionneer species that dominate the recruited community 12 years after disturbance.</p>
<p>After this first recruitment phase, in the case of low disturbance intensity (T1 plots) the recruitment was higly similar to the pre-disturbance community as revealed by the random sampling. This argues for the existence of recruitment limitation in the medium-term <em>????meaning the strive of a variety of species, even when not the most fitted for the environmental context, because the best competitors couldn’t set in disturbed area???? to be rewritten</em>. The key role of recruitment limitation in recovery dynamic was already highlighted for low disturbance intensity in tropical wet forests <span class="citation">(Hubbell et al. 1999; Sheil and Burslem 2003; Bongers et al. 2009)</span> and supported the IDH as it mitigates competitive exclusion and maintains some inferior competitiors in the community. Recruitment and dispersal limitation are consistent with the short dispersal distance observed for tropical trees, and it was already highlighted in Paracou through the genetic clumping observed for some pioneers <span class="citation">(Leclerc et al. 2015; Scotti et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>In the case of high disturbance intensity, the species turnover remains very high after the initial 10 year phasis and the functional diversity decreased sharply, along a general functional shift towards acquisitive functional strategies. This was marked for nearly all functional traits of the leaf and stem and for life history traits (Leaf thickness, Wood Specific Gravity and Hmax) which values represented a community of fast-growing long-lived species with a high resources acquisition strategies <span class="citation">(I. J. Wright et al. 2004; J. Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011; Reich 2014)</span>. The time elpased between disturbance and the significance of those functional and diversity shifts suggests that the second recruitment phase stems from the germination of long-lived pioneers at the moment of the disturbance. <em>here i think that we are seeing the effect of long-lived pioneers, and this should be discusssed. especially the functional differences between long- and short-lived pioneers</em></p>
<p><em>?????Eventually, we observed that disturbance induced particular recruitment mechanisms but also set aside mechanisms at stake in natural plots.????</em></p>

<div id="on-the-resilience-of-the-recruitment-process" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> On the resilience of the recruitment process</h2>
<p>Thirty years after the disturbance event, the functional diversity <em>not true for all traits, i.e. wood density</em> had recovered whatever the disturbance intensity but significant taxonomic diversity difference persisted for high disturbance levels. Would this mean that ecosystem functioning recover faster than taxonomic composition? The link between functional traits and ecpsystem functionning is not trivial but our results may highlight the key role of functional redundancy in ecological systems and also suggest that the recovery trajectory may be, more than commonly thought, upon dependence of the pre-disturbance functional ecosystem signature <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>. Whatever the disturbance intensity, the recruitment turnover compared to initial stand ended up close to zero. This again argue for the high dependence of the recovery trajectory on the pre-disturbance ecosystem characteristics <span class="citation">(Anderson 2007)</span>. In other words, initial compositional variation caused tree communities to remain divergent in taxonomic composition, even though these same tree communities strongly converged in functional space <span class="citation">(Fukami et al. 2005)</span>. This makes these commmunities both highly functionally and taxonomically resilient. Our results extend previous ones from the Paracou experiment, 10 years <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span> and 20 years <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span> after disturbance that suggested the recovery towards pre-disturbance taxonomic and functional composition. This is however only valid for a single disturbance event, given that second recruitment phase assumed to rely on the seed bank triggers a storage effect likely to modify the recruitment trajectories in case of a new disturbance event. In this hypothetical case, the competitive exclusion among dormant life-stage (seeds or even seedlings) would be harsher and would bring more radical changes in the recruitment composition and functional profile.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>Our long-term study of diversity trajectories after disturbance disentangled the mechanisms underlying the forest trajectory in the diversity space. While, in undisturbed forests, mechanisms like negative density dependence enhanced species diversity, a single disturbance event induced new mechanisms depending on the event intensity. Whatever the intensity, communities short-term response reflected the enhanced growth of already grown saplings which increased the taxonomic and functional evenness of the community. In the long-term, the community trajectory strongly depends on the disturbance intensity. For low intensity, recruitment limitation was balanced against environmental filters and induced a recruited community mirroring the pre-disturbance community composition. For high intensity, the species turnover remains very high and induced a recruited community significantly dominated by acquisitive functional types and a restricted pool of species. <em>In both cases, the recruitment trajectory is specific, because it is determined by the surrounding forest in case of low disturbance or because the competitive exclusion randomly selected a restricted pool of species after intense disturbance.?????</em></p>
