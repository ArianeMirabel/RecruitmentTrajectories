<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> The emergence of deterministic successional pathway</h2>
<p>The post-disturbance trajectories were analyzed through the botanical uncertainty propagation framework that proved accurate enough to significantly discriminate the different taxonomic trajectories, and to analyze the trends in functional trajectories.</p>
<p>Our taxonomic and functional analysis of recruited communities showed that following disturance, recruited communities were dominated by pioneers and light-demanding species while shade-tolerant, late successional species were dominant in undisturbed communities.
Post-disturbance recruitment trajectories followed a two-phased successional pathway defined by the emergence of deterministic competition for light temporarily offsetting the stochastic processes predominant in undisturbed communities <span class="citation">(Clements 1916; Denslow and Guzman 2000; Meiners et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>A first phase was defined by the gradual increase of the taxonomic turnover between recruited trees and initial communities (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:Turnover">3.3</a>) and the divergence between observed and null model trajectories (Figure (<a href="results.html#fig:DivTraj">3.1</a>).
The first phase would correspond to a less stochastic recruitment, <em>i.e.</em> deterministic, which taxonomic composition diverged from the pre-disturbance, undisturbed community.
In the first place, recruited species comprised both pioneers, like <em>Cecropia obtusa</em>, and late-successional species, like <em>Lecythis persistens</em> or <em>Licania alba</em> corresponding to the growth of pre-disturbance surviving saplings (with DBH &lt; 10 cm).
These saplings were the first to benefit from the reduced competition and the increased light availability following disturbances and fostering plant productivity and growth <span class="citation">(Monteith 1972; Chazdon and Fetcher 1984)</span>.
Then, recruited species became mainly pioneers, belonging to <em>Cecropia</em> or <em>Vismia</em> genera, or non-pioneer light demanding species belonging to <em>Miconia</em>, <em>Oxandra</em>, or <em>Xylopia</em> genera.
Until 15-20 years following disturbance, recruitment processes were modified by the emergence of deterministic processes favoring a restricted pool of pioneers and light-demanding species resulting in a decrease of the taxonomic richness and evenness of recruited communities.
The relative importance of these deterministic processes offsetting the stochastic recruitment of undisturbed communities increased with the disturbance intensity <span class="citation">(Bongers et al. 2009)</span>.
Along with the decrease in recruited communities taxonomic richness and evenness, the functional composition shifted from a random trait assembly to more “resource-acquisitive” functional strategies (Figure 2).
Recruits specifically displayed higher light acquisition efficiency, <em>i.e.</em> high SLA and low maximum height, leaf toughness and wood specific gravity <span class="citation">(Wright et al. 2004; Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011)</span>.
This shift towards “light acquisitive” functional strategies was coherent with the assumed role of light availability in the post-disturbance successional pathways, as already demonstrated in temperate and tropical forests <span class="citation">(Peña-Claros et al. 2008; Carreño-Rocabado et al. 2012; Kunstler et al. 2016; Both et al. 2019)</span>.</p>

<div id="return-towards-pre-disturbance-recruitment-processes" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Return towards pre-disturbance recruitment processes</h2>
<p>Following the first recruitment phase, until 15 to 20 years depending on the disturbance intensity, recruitment trajectories showed a return towards pre-disturbance values of functional diversity and taxonomic richness, while taxonomic evenness and functional composition remained altered (Figure (<a href="results.html#fig:DivTraj">3.1</a>) &amp; (<a href="results.html#fig:CWM">3.2</a>)).
Although pioneers and light-demanding species, like those belonging to <em>Inga</em> or <em>Miconia</em> genera, remained dominant in recruited communities late-successionals, like <em>Licania alba</em>, progressively established <span class="citation">(Fortunel et al. 2014)</span>.
The recruitment of late-successionals could reflect the progressive closing of the forest canopy and the increase in competition for light and space <span class="citation">(Peet 1992; Denslow and Guzman 2000)</span>. Deterministic recruitment processes, in turn, would be offset by stochastic recruitment characteristic of undisturbed forest <span class="citation">(Lawton and Putz 1988; Chave 2004)</span>.
A second recruitment phase then corresponded to a return toward pre-disturbance community taxonomic and functional composition and diversity states <span class="citation">(Fukami et al. 2005; Fortunel et al. 2014)</span>.
Such return towards pre-disturbance state would mean the maintenance of community diversity and composition after disturbance. It suggested that few species absent before disturbance were recruited, in accordance with the importance of dispersal limitations among tropical tree species <span class="citation">(Svenning and Wright 2005)</span>.
The return towards pre-disturbance state would confirm previous results obtained in the Paracou experiment, conducted 10 years <span class="citation">(Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span> and 20 years <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span> after disturbance.
Both studies showed the same changes in community taxonomic and functional composition but the second study, conducted later, showed lower contrasts among disturbed plots. This was interpreted as the signs of a return towards pre-disturbance states, as species detected in the first study were short-lived pioneers that did not persist until the second study.</p>
<p>Although community trajectories returned towards pre-disturbance states, both taxonomic and functional characteristics remained, 30 years after the disturbance, different from pre-disturbance communities and control plot values.
The higher the disturbance intensity, the more persistent the dominance of light-demanding species. Such a long-term impact raises questions for the management of tropical forests as most valuable species are late-successional species, and their exploitation would consequently require cutting cycles longer than 30 years <span class="citation">(Putz et al. 2012)</span>.
Furthermore, persistent changes in community composition likely alter community functioning <span class="citation">(Díaz et al. 2005)</span>, and increase the risk of losing keystone species, with unexpected ecological consequences <span class="citation">(Jones, Lawton, and Shachak 1994; Chazdon 2003)</span>.
Infrequent species might indeed have unique functional characteristics in the ecosystem, apart from the ones considered here, or be a key resource for some of the fauna <span class="citation">(Schleuning et al. 2016)</span>.</p>
