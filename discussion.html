<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> The three phases of recruitment trajectories</h2>
<p>Along the 30 years, the recruitment richness and species turnover compared to the initial composition, and the trajectories of key functional traits (SLA and bark thickness) exhibited clear hump-shaped trajectories, revealing three distinct recruitment phases. Communities trajectories involved an interplay between stochastic and deterministic recruitment, first involving species competitive exclusion and then niche partitioning, before recovering initial recruitment processes.</p>
<p>As a first step (0-8 years), recruited trees showed low turnover compared to the initial composition and matched the functional diversity of a stochastic recruitment process. This first recruitment phase mirroring the old-growth pre-disturbance community then likely involved already grown saplings (DBH &lt;10cm) immediatly benefitting from the increased enlightment and the alleviated competition induced by disturbance <span class="citation">(Hérault et al. 2010)</span>.</p>
<p>A second phase (8-15 years) then fall into place, corresponding to marked changes in several functional traits trajectories and to a decrease in recruitment evenness and functional diversity. This second phase likely incorporated true recruits, <em>i.e.</em> trees germinated from the seed bank that constitute the main part of the recruitment <span class="citation">(Lawton and Putz 1988)</span>. The pool of species recruited then was restricted according to their resource acquisition strategy and revealed the deterministic processes that balanced the stochastic recruitment observed in the first place. Indeed, sharp changes in the SLA, wood density and leaf thickness trajectories occured after intense disturbance and revealed the prominent recruitment of short-lived, fast growing hard pionneer species with competitive and efficient light acquisition <span class="citation">(I. J. Wright et al. 2004; J. Chave et al. 2009; Hérault et al. 2011; Reich 2014)</span>.<br />
The recruitment was therefore shaped by exclusive competition among species based on their competitive ability differences for light acquisition <span class="citation">(Mayfield and Levine 2010)</span>, as already demonstrated in for tree species in temperate forests <span class="citation">(Kunstler et al. 2012)</span>. The balance between deterministic and stochastic processes shaping the second phase was determined by the initial disturbance intensity. After light disturbance (T1 plots), despite the pool of recruited species was restricted, the species turnover compared to initial state remained low. Recruited trees then still mirrored the pre-disturbance communities but recruited species were more pioneers and light demanders, with strategies of efficient resource acquisition (high SLA and leaf chlorophyll content) and inexpensive, short-lived tissues (low leaf thickness and thoughness, small Hmax and low wood density and bark thickness) <span class="citation">(S P Hubbell et al. 1999; Schnitzer and Carson 2001; Sheil and Burslem 2003; Bongers et al. 2009)</span>. At this disturbance intensity the recruitment evenness and functional diversity remained high so despite the selection of more light-demanding species the recruitment was not overwhelmed by hard pioneers. This might be explained by the recruitment and dispersal limitations due to the short dispersal distance observed for tropical trees, specifically in Paracou with the genetic clumping of some pioneers <span class="citation">(Leclerc et al. 2015; Scotti et al. 2015)</span>. After intense disturbance in contrast (T2 and T3 plots), the recruitment rapidly differed from the pre-disturbance composition and corresponded to a sharp increase of the SLA and bark thickness. These drastic trajectories changes reflected an overhelming recruitment of hard pioneers likely entailing significant changes in communities functioning <span class="citation">(S Díaz et al. 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>A third recruitment phase eventually entailed a return towards initial taxonomic and functional diversities. Recruited species remained mainly light-demanding and still submitted to competitive exclusion, but their functional diversity and their compositional similarity with initial communities progressively increased which revealed the recovery of stochastic recruitment processes dominating in mature forests <span class="citation">(Lawton and Putz 1988; Mayfield and Levine 2010)</span>.</p>
<p>The recruitment trajectories proved identical in disturbed versus untouched areas with plots, suggesting community scale processes. In undisturbed forests the light availability proved quite homogeneous and unrelated to trees recruitment success <span class="citation">(Dalling and Hubbell 2002)</span> while disturbance gaps and associated edge effect significantly increasing the global enlightment enhancing trees recruitment success <span class="citation">(Rüger et al. 2009)</span>.</p>

<div id="the-questioned-completeness-of-communities-resilience" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> The questioned completeness of communities resilience</h2>
<p>After 30 years, although taxonomic and functional diversity had recovered initial values, the recruitment processes remained submitted to the deterministic selection of recruited species in contrast with the stochastic recruitment of undisturbed forests. The recruitment processes proved then consistently resilient but after long time period.</p>
<p>The recovery of recruitment processes proceeded along with the recovery of initial composition and diversity. This return towards initial, pre-disturbance state meant the maintenance of their difference in composition and suggested the existence of multiple stable equilibrium, as suggested for the highly diverse and productive ecosystems by <span class="citation">Chase (2003)</span>. To maintain initial differences taxonomic trajectory would then depend on initial states, consistently with previous observation and with the observed mobilisation of local seed banks that largely varies in tropical forests <span class="citation">(Dalling and Hubbell 2002; Anderson 2007)</span>. The multiple communities composition restored by deterministic processes and then stochastically maintained suggest that tropical forest communities regionally rely on deterministic assembly processes building a regional species pool declined in locally divergent, randomly drifting communities.</p>
<p>In contrast the trajectories of traits and functional diversity were essentially similar among treatments, arguing for the confluence of communities in the functional space despite their divergence in taxonomic space <span class="citation">(Fukami et al. 2005)</span>. This confirmed previous results from the Paracou experiment, conducted 10 years <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span> and 20 years <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span> after disturbance, where the early signs of the resilience of taxonomic and functional composition had been detected.</p>
<p>Although ongoing, communities recovery proved slow as functional diversity and several traits values remained altered 30 years after disturbance. The long-lasting taxonomic and functional recovery besides impacted the seed bank, which is the stock of recruitable species. The seed bank significantly determines communities recovery so its involvment might alter the resilience of the community and its response to further disturbance <span class="citation">(Norden et al. 2009)</span>.</p>
